<subject>anyone looking for a bike repair instructional video?</subject><content>i am a young bike mechanic with a few years experience working on bikes. i have accumulated a mass of information during these years, especially upgrading a project bike from $200 to $1700, and working with several friends' bikes.&#xa;&#xa;i was thinking of making an instructional movie on mountain bike repair for anyone who has a bike. it would include every aspect of mtb repair. i would package it on a professional looking DVD with a text file to go along with the DVD.&#xa;&#xa;i no there are not a whole bunch of movies that teach these sort of things for beginners and pros alike. i would sell the package at around $15 for the DVD and manual (cheaper than any other reapir vid i've seen) do you think there is a demand for a product such as this?</content>

<subject>Did Rumsfeld step down out of fear or intelligence?</subject><content>I can't quite decide if old Donald got out of Dodge because he felt the winds of change or if it is a political move.

Because usually it only starts with one, but before long they all get going. I know they want to say hi, but I just want them to do it a bit quieter. They are all nice sweet dogs who just love people.</content>

<subject>Why are Online Games so expensive?</subject><content>Recently Lineage II went on a rampage against the free server L2EXTREME... they got the FBI involved and shut it down.&#xa;&#xa;Why do that think everyone can afford to pay $15 a month to play a silly video game?  Honestly, with 500,000+ users Lineage is earning $7,500,000 a year!!&#xa;&#xa;Don't they realize that if they'd be reasonable and charge $5 - $8 they'd more than triple thier user base?  Especially considering the largest group who play are children and teens.  I'd much rather play the commercial server, it's more reliable and hacker proof.&#xa;&#xa;http://www.lineage2.com/news/news.html#a007871</content>

<subject>Persistant cough...what could it be?</subject><content>My 5 yr old has been coughing for almost two months. We have taken him to the doctor 6 times and still they tell us nothing is wrong. It doesn't seem normal that he should be sick this long. He also has a bit of a runny nose and coughs up mucus. He had an ear infection one week but they have said it's healed. He was on antibiotics for that week (for ear infection) but the cough has not gone away, only the ear infection. I am tired of seeing my baby coughing. When I cough alot my chest and muscles begin to hurt and I can only imagine what it feels like for a small baby. If anyone has any thoughts on what this may be please let me know. We have tried the steam and humidifier too...doesnt work</content>

<subject>British Muslims &amp; Iraq? Whats it got to do with them?</subject><content>As an Iraqi (ethnic Assyrian) i find it puzzling and extremely annoying when some(not all) british muslims, ie Bangladeshi &amp; Pakistanis feel they have the right to pontificate about iraq. They use it as an excuse to project their dislike of britain, its people and culture. Iraq has nothing to do with Asian muslims, there is no connection in race, language, history, culture, geography and appearance. They are not our "brothers" so whats their excuse? And dont mention islam, if that were the case they'd all be off to Darfur to protect the black muslims being slaughtered in their millions! Also, iraq under Saddam was secular, and not an islamic state. As an iraqi id like to tell them to sod off, the sons of dogs!</content>

<subject>What's it called...?</subject><content>So, the dilemma is, I am working fulltime. I pay a babysitter who lives 20 miles away from me (closest one I could find believe it or not) to watch my four month old for 125 a week. I get paid bi-weekly and bring home (if I am lucky) 600 every two weeks. So, a little less than 300 a week and after a babysitter, its 175. Take away the gas for there and back twice a day for the week, I am looking at bringing home a little less than a hundred dollars a week. &#xa;&#xa;It's not that I have a bad paying job. I get paid nine dollars an hour which is above average for around here, but to work and bring home less than what you pay a babysitter is ridiculous. &#xa;&#xa;So my question (finally), is what is the program called in which you get help paying for childcare?</content>

Now he is emailing me about the tracking number. &#xa;&#xa;Do you buy a tracking number? We never agreed, and nowhere on the auction did I say anything about tracking, but since this is my first sale, I don't know what to do. I shipped it without buying anything else (apart from bubble wrap and the box.) Where do I get the tracking number? Does the package even have one? Are you supposed to pay extra for it? If my package doesn't have a tracking number, then what information can I give him so he knows I sent it? Please help, since he wants a response by the end of today, it's pretty urgent.</content>

<subject>Want to start a small retail business at a local marketplace. Any advice?</subject><content>I am interested in starting a small retail business at a local flea market. This flea market is not one of those with just tables sitting out in the weather. It is several different buildings with a different store in each, though they due have some covered tables as well. This particular flea market has a hardware store, army surplus store, crafts store, variety store, natural products store, and a couple of others that sell various things. It is located beside a busy road with lots of traffic. I have sold at flea markets before with various degrees of success. I want to start this as a sideline and say how well it goes. I have about three wholesale sources lined up who I have bought from before. I am looking to sell primarly dvds and videos, though I plan to carry other items as well. &#xa;&#xa;How much inventory should I start out with? I don't have a great deal of money to start with and know there is some risk involved. It is getting close to Christmas, probably missed the busy season.</content>

My mom didnt know I was sexually active&amp; I dont think she agrees w/ premarital sex ingeneral.  So shes looking@ me like "please answer no", so i finally turn to her&amp; say "yes mom, i AM sexually active" (i have a boyfriend) &amp; returned to the Dr.s questions.&#xa;&#xa;When we got home, my mom got all mad, telling me im too young to have sex (im 19), &amp;that I could get pregnant (im on birthcontrol).  Then she asked me WHY I have sex, i didnt have an answer.  I care about my boyfriend, he cares about me&amp; it feels good, but I want to say exacly that.  I dont think my lack of a long meaningful answer reflects that I shouldnt have sex.  I know shes gonna ask me again, how can I convey that she has no control over this!?</content>

<subject>Am I old fashioned?</subject><content>I am chivalrous.  I hold the door open for everyone, men or women.  I say sir and ma'am to people I am not really close to.  I look people in the eyes when I talk to them.  I respect everyone, even people I don't know.  I do not judge people by first appearances or by what I hear, only by what I know, and even then I don't condemn them.  I take responsibility for all my actions no matter what the consequences.  I do not care what other people think of me, the people who know me know to believe about me.  I do not spread rumors.  I ignore the rumors about myself.  I let older people ahead of me when waiting in line.  I stop for everyone in the crosswalk.  I try to help everyone in any way possible, and always turn down any reward offered.  My real friends can talk to me with confidence, as can anyone else.  The people I work with appreciate me, as I will do whatever I can to make their lives easier.  Without trying to, or profiting from it, my employers love me.  Am I old fashioned?</content>

<subject>Most women are attracted to handsome naked men. Why does society want us to hide it? Men don't hide it.?</subject><content>Women are taught by media/society to hide their sexual feelings. I don't think this is right. I think this is why men are so confused about women. Also, most of the stuff on television is geared toward men; their sexual thoughts and needs. They hardly ever show a woman's. And lastly, I would like to see more naked men. I'm tired of seeing boobs in every new movie. Maybe that's why women now watch more porn.</content>

<subject>Shouldn't married Girls-Night-Out or Boys-Night-Out have rules against interaction with the opposite sex?</subject><content>Personally I am OK with my wife going out with the girlls.  The only exception is her going to dance halls and dancing with strangers.  Don't you think they have another agenda on their minds.  Ladies can safely go to concerts, dinner, bowling, card games, etc, as long as the planned activity does not involve the possibility that other men will join them.  Trust &amp; jealousy are not the issues here.  I feel they are asking for trouble, and there is the possibility that the worst case scenarios could occur.  Certainly it is OK to dance with a friend's spouse when everyone is in attendance.  I seriously doubt that a married woman ever goes to dance with the prior intention of fooling around.  Although, for her to deny the possibility is for her to deny reality.  For Instance, she could easily find someone who is a better dancer than her husband, and want him to become her regular dance partner.  Even on a non-sexual basis, it would destroy her marriage?</content>

<subject>Does this guy really like me or what?</subject><content>We've been friends for awhile and last November we almost went out but he said he didn't want to screw up our friendship. We've always had one of those friendships where we can talk about anything, I mean anything. I've been out with 3 guys since then and I was treated pretty badly by the first guy and the next two guys were just rebound guys...this guy who I've liked forever, Kyle, has liked other girls in the meantime and I've always been there for him but I find that when I'm drunk and I call people its always him I call. I know I like him in a way that I haven't liked anyone ever, but I can't tell if he feels the same way...he always calls me gorgeous, beautiful etc whenever I complain about not getting the guy I want. We've even considered becoming friends with benefits...and we've talked about sex etc a lot. But, that's not my point. I want to find out if he likes me back...What can I do/say to let him know I like him, but not ruin our friendship, if he doesn't like me back?</content>

Whenever I go to bed or say I am napping whether its a 1 hour nap or I am getting up from a nights sleep I have to hobble out of bed until I get moving more--this has been going on for the last couple of months it almost feels kind of like tendonitis in the ankles, however my calves are so tight when I first get up that they hurt to move as well...I mean I am not 18 but I am not old either is this normal you think or is it just from being stiff from sleeping through the night? cause once i get moving around I can walk just fine and stuff. &#xa;&#xa;just curious--thanks--Jammiegirl</content>

<subject>Is he ashamed of me or am I over reacting?</subject><content>My fiance and I went to a car dealer a a few days before I got enaged. He was buying his parents a brand new car when they aready had a car.  The car dealer thought I was his wife but my fiance said that I was a good friend. Him introducing me as a good friend to the car dealer bothered me. So I discussed it with my fiance and he said the car dealer doesn't need to know his personal life. A acouple of days later he went to the car dealer again without me &amp; my fiance and him have been talking about me. Because my fiance told me so. Now when he goes to get oil change or a free car wash there he doesn't go with me.  When we were spending time together one day he needed to see the car dealer so he dropped me off at my house &amp; picked me up after he was done. When I call him while he is working he sometimes doesn't say that he loves me. He just talks to me like he would talk to casual friend. But when we are alone he is very lovey dovey.  I am Indian  he is white. Is he ashamed of  my race?</content>

When she asks me if me &amp; the guy mentioned above have been seeing each other.  &#xa;&#xa;I said "No, he doesn't like me.  I have been upfront that I am interested but he says he feels nothing.  So, ya know, can't change that.  Why? Does he talk about me or something?"&#xa;&#xa;She said "He has said that you guys hang out and ya'll are friends, but he isn't ready for anything serious right now (which I don't blame him) he just has a lot on his mind..."&#xa;&#xa;I was surprised that he even mentioned me to her.  Do you think that he could possible consider me as a future option? That he likes me and is just scared?</content>

<subject>How can i stop taking so many pain killers.?</subject><content>My doctor prescribed me Strong Co-codamol tablets about 2 and half years ago for bad stomach pains. They really helped so i started using them all the time. I noticed that when i took them i was getting a buzz from them a sort of head rush and a nice feeling through my body.&#xa;&#xa;Now i just take them to get the buzz but have found i keep needing to take more to  get the buzz and it is not lasting as long.&#xa;&#xa;I take about 10 of the prescribed tablets a day but have also been buying the weaker ones from the chemist and using some of them in between. I have tried to stop but my body doesn't feel the same without them and i get ill. My doctor did recentley call me in to discuss why i keep  putting prescription requests in so early and ask how many i take. I did lie a little and said about 8 a day he didnt seem to concerned and has said that they are going to moniter the situation and wont give me tablets early anymore.&#xa;&#xa;I am starting to get worried that i could damage my body .</content>

<subject>I'm afraid of vomit... what should I do?</subject><content>Don't laugh... I have had this fear of vomit and vomiting since I was a kid.  I panic whenever I think someone near me is about to vomit, if someone in the vicinity has already started vomiting, or if someone has just vomited.&#xa;&#xa;I can't stand the smell/sight/sound of vomit or someone vomiting... it seriously scares me a lot, and I go into fight-or-flight mode: I get very tense, jittery, light-headed, and my heart races.&#xa;&#xa;I am also afraid of myself vomiting.  Aside from an unfortunate incident in college when I had a little too much to drink, I haven't vomited since I was 7, and I'm 24 now.&#xa;&#xa;I'm somewhat afraid to hold babies because I'm afraid they're going to vomit on me, although a baby vomiting isn't quite as scary as a child or adult vomiting.  At the same time though, I really want to have kids someday.  How can I care for kids (especially when they're sick) if I'm so afraid of them vomiting?&#xa;&#xa;I seriously think I have a problem.  What can I do to get over this?</content>

<subject>Is an 18 yr. old (female) an a 33 yr. old (male) compatible? Even if the 33 yr.old is in a relationship w/kids</subject><content>I am 33 and have two children w/ a 42 yr.old woman who i love and care about, but I did fall in love with an 18 yr. old young lady. They both know just about everything there is to know about eachother and the relationship the 18 yr. old and I have (minus sex), however I think the "wife" probably has that figured out and is not pushing the issue for some reason. I love my "wife" but I am IN love with my "mistress". I dont know what is right, wrong or indifferent. The story gets even more complicated, obviously from my end anyway, and just was curious as to what I could do to help myself be more aware of exactly what it is I have gotten myself into and what I can do to clear up some issues that seem to hold some of the answers needed to be as honest and fair as humanly possible to all persons involved. Including the children. I want to add the fact that this 18 yr.old is not typical, I know everyone whos done this has probably said the same thing, but she is very unique. What do I do..?</content>

<subject>Why would anyone choose to be a Satanist, in the most literal sense?</subject><content>I'm not aware of any other religion outside of Christianity, Judaism, Muslims that actually believe in a Satan.&#xa;So I'm assuming (wrongfully?) that Satan is exclusive to those that accept the Bible as "word." &#xa;Assuming that the Bible is true, why would anyone after reading the Book of Revelations decide to become a Satanist? He loses the war according to this book, so why would anyone take his side?&#xa;&#xa;I've been to some of the Satanist sites and some claim that they don't really believe in a Satan, etc. I understood their concept, but I'm addressing the ones that write 666 and praise Satan. &#xa;&#xa;BTW, I'm leaning a degree more toward atheist than I am agnostic.</content>

<subject>Chihuahua with BAD breath!?</subject><content>My 1 yr old chihuahua MiMi has HORRIBLE breath and I can't figure out why!? &#xa;&#xa;I've changed her food, and it made no difference. She doesn't have any dental problems. She chews dental bones and Greenies regularly. &#xa;&#xa;I bought breath spray at Petco made by Petrodex. It says it cleans gums and teeth, soothes irritated gums, fights bacteria that causes plaque and Helps control offensive bad breath. I've been spraying it liberally into her mouth almost everyday but it still isn't helping!&#xa;&#xa;She hasn't always had bad breath, only for about 4-5 months. I also have a 4 month old chihuahua whose breath is fine, so I'm pretty sure it has nothing to do with anything in the house.&#xa;&#xa;My friends and family don't even want to hold her anymore because her breath is so bad! What can I do to control it?</content>

At the moment past 6 the minute hand traveling downwards will have a increase of speed of x% every minute due to gravity. At 6:15 the speed of the minute minute hand will be of constant speed until 6:30. Since the hour hand at 6 is traveling upwards against gravity, its motion will be slowed by y% every hour until 9:00. After 9 the hand will have a constant speed until midnight. If clock B is place in a weightless enviroment, the minute and hour hand will perfectly match each other some time after 6 o clock.

<subject>Friends in financial trouble..?</subject><content>My friend lives with her boyfriend and young daughter.  They have a mortgage on 50% of their house - the other half is rented from housing association.  They both work full time.  &#xa;&#xa;She has recently discovered her boyfriend has run up debts of £60k which they are struggling to meet the minimal payments on along with their mortgage/rent etc; and she can hardly afford to buy food/petrol.  &#xa;&#xa;He wants to go bankrupt.  My advice to her was to apply for an IVA as an alternative.  She has made a provisional phonecall to discuss whether he would be suitable and it seems he probably would.&#xa;&#xa;Her fear is that she will lose her house or have to remortgage the half they own to clear down his debts  - and I do not know the answer to this.  &#xa;&#xa;Given they are not married and they jointly own the equity in half of the house, would anyone know where she would stand financially in all this mess?  Will she lose her house anyway - could he be forced to sell his quarter share?  Is an IVA a solution?</content>

Most the time they don't line up at WR it is mostly RB's who get the passes.  But as the DB takes the player going for the pass what are the fundamentals to teach them?  How much cushion, when to look at the QB etc.  Also how to teahc them to recognize the pass versus run?</content>

Whats even crazier is that where I grew up, the blacks and indians were predjudice to eachother.  I just dont get it.

<subject>What do you do when you are being criticized?</subject><content>Recently, I was confronted with criticisms towards our group. &#xa;&#xa;What hurts the most is that they are talking to me as if I am not part of the group when all the while they keep putting us down--making a list of all that we did wrong. &#xa;&#xa;Honestly, they do have a point and we would, of course, consider everything they said. &#xa;&#xa;The only problem is that they are putting it on a completely personal level--blaming us for everything that had happened all the time and constantly reminding us of our mistakes.</content>
<subject>Questions for K-5 teachers/parents of K-5 students/elementary school principals?</subject><content>This information is for a research paper I am doing and I need some opinions from teachers, parents and/or elementary school principals. I am doing a research paper on the effectiveness of homework for elementary students. I have about 5 background questions and the 3-5 questions about homework. The information will be used in my paper and shared with my class and teacher. We are also required to submit our final paper to a local newspaper or journal so there is a possibility that it may be published. Because the survey asks for some background information and I know some people don‘t feel comfortable posting information on here, if you are interested in helping me please e-mail me at weberKCK@AOL.com to let me know and I will e-mail you the questions for you to answer and send back to me. Thank you to anyone who can help me out with this.</content>
<subject>Is there any need to visit a physiotherapist when arm cast is off?</subject><content>I had an arm cast on for 4-5 weeks because I broke my radius bone in my wrist. Anyway, when the doctors took off my arm cast they booked me an appointment with a physiotherapist. I heard they only help movement in the arm that was affected by damage, but my arm/wrist moves alright.. is it essential to visit a physiotherapist or can I just skip it? Will it affect anything?</content>
<subject>heres a funny joke?</subject><content>Little Mary was not the best student in Sunday School. Usually she slept through the class. One day the teacher called on her while she was napping, ''Tell me, Mary, who created the universe?'' &#xa;&#xa;When Mary didn't stir, little Johnny, an altruistic boy seated in the chair behind her, took a pin and jabbed her in the rear. ''God Almighty !'' shouted Mary and the teacher said, ''Very good'' and Mary fell back to sleep.&#xa;&#xa;A while later the teacher asked Mary, ''Who is our Lord and Savior?'' But Mary didn't even stir from her slumber. Once again, Johnny came to the rescue and stuck her again. ''Jesus Christ!'' shouted Mary and the teacher said, ''Very good,'' and Mary fell back to sleep. &#xa;&#xa;Then the teacher asked Mary a third question, ''What did Eve say to Adam after she had her twenty-third child?'' And again, Johnny jabbed her with the pin. This time Mary jumped up and shouted, ''If you stick that damn thing in me one more time, I'll break it in half!'' &#xa;&#xa;The Teacher fainted.</content>

<subject>Is she being sneaky?</subject><content>my bf of 7 years (who i have 2 sons with) has daughter by this girl. This little girl can barely talk. she isnt quite 2 years old so she kinda just rambles. But this girl will keep having the little girl leave messages on his phone like every day or every other day while shes in the ground telling her daughter to say things like "love you dada", "hi", bye"and just directing the conversation herself. Now I have to add that this girl cant get over my man but tries to play it off like hes no big deal and she absolutely hates me and my kids. She gets mad b/c hes with me and wont let the little girl around me. Do you think she is trying to be funny to get him to talk to her or feel bad or something or get in contact with her or am i just being crazy? I mean its not like the little girl even understands who she is leaving messages for or what she is even saying to do it every other day.</content>

<subject>Christians only! Do you know that the Pre-Tribulation Rapture is a false doctrine?</subject><content>There is no scriptural basis for this belief; only conjecture, twisting of scriptures and unfounded "leaps of faith". &#xa; &#xa;I am not contesting the validity of the rapture; even though that word is not in the Bible, it is very clear that that is a valid thing.&#xa;&#xa;The second coming of the Lord Jesus and the rapture are simultaneous events, the time of the harvest!&#xa;&#xa;The actual timing of the event should be called the "Pre-Wrath Rapture" because it happens at the 7th trumpet of Revelation just prior to the vials of God's wrath being poured out on the earth.&#xa;&#xa;Matthew 24:29, 30, &amp; 31 lays it out so that even the simple-minded can understand:  29: Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: &#xa;30: And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. &#xa;31: And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</content>
<subject>Thoughts on "conception moons"?</subject><content>OK so the new thing to take is called a "conceptionmoon" and it is for couples that want to get pregnant. They go on a vacation to get pregnant because their schedules are too hectic.&#xa;&#xa;Does anyone see the messed up logic in this?&#xa;&#xa;They are too busy to get pregnant but they think they will have time to raise a child? A human being? an infant with needs 24/7? and then that little baby will grow up and just have more  needs!&#xa;&#xa;If a couple is suffering from infertility and getting away on a vacation relaxes them, ok fine. &#xa;&#xa;But the rationale used by couples for the said conceptionmoon is that they are too busy with work, etc. to connect.&#xa;&#xa;Seriously sad in my opinion. Oh and selfish (to add another 's' word)</content>

What are the chances that I could be pregnant? Any take... ? I know I should just get a home pregnancy test, but I don't want to seem like I'm overreacting.

We have been through allot in the past couple months. We lost our first baby together. Since then it seems to be going sour. We got into a big fight the mon  night and he got violent and was trying to leave but i wouldn't let him. He didn't hit me. I just cain't see myself without him. He came home from work the next day and told me he was sorry. Then last night we got into it again but just arguing. It hurt my feelings cuz he kept bring up my mistakes that ive made and throwing stuff in my face that i trusted him with. and it's only when he drinks. Tonight were going to sit down and talk. He told me lastnight that we may not be ment. But yet he tells me he loves me that night and this morning. What am i suppose to do? I love him and do anything for this man but i don't want this to be routine and him to forgive me and look at the good im doing now. I know we can save it. Is there any advice.</content>

<subject>Should I tell him or what?</subject><content>I have this friend that I had a crush on him ever since I was 13. We got 2gether when I was 18 &amp; it was a brief sexually encounter. Then we lost touch. Now 8yrs later I have 3 kids he has 4, but he has 3 w/ the same chick. They've been 2gether ever since. We recently reunited, we talk on the phone &amp; he visits when he can. Its nothing sexual, we find that we r connected mentally more than anything. Plus I care about this man so much that I would NEVER cross the line 4 a few good hrs. of sex. But this chick that hes w/ doesn't deserve him, doesn't know how to treat him. Doesn't know what shes got. The irony is that he knows all that, but remains with her. He won't leave his kids he says that time and time again. I stay cool be there as a friend; a listening ear, but deep down I want this man, in every way possible. I want to be the WOMAN he needs and deserves, but I'm scared to tell him how I feel; fear that he will look at me in a different way; fear that he doesn't feel the same way.</content>

<subject>Husband and his friend......?</subject><content>I'm probably just being hormonal, but when one gets married, shouldn't they stop having one on one out time with the opposite sex?  For instance, I still go out with friends, but I don't go alone with a male friend. Yet my husband will go meet with his friend (a girl), alone. It's getting me paranoid as hell (he cheated on me in the beginning of our relationship, and we broke up because of it, only to reconcile 5 months later- all pre-marriage tho). &#xa;&#xa;Would it be too bitchy for me to ask him to not see her alone? I don't mind if they go out, but not while alone. But at the same time, I'm afraid of setting that boundary, and then he starts lying to me instead. I'm just at a loss of what to do in this situation.&#xa;&#xa;What would you do? This situation makes me feel uneasy. The last time I felt uneasy, he cheated on me.</content>

<subject>Playful Sex?</subject><content>A couple of women were playing golf one sunny Saturday morning. The first of the twosome teed off and watched in horror as her ball headed directly toward a foursome of men playing the next hole. &#xa;&#xa;Indeed, the ball hit one of the men, and he immediately clasped his hands together at his crotch, fell to the ground, and proceeded to roll around in evident agony. &#xa;&#xa;The woman rushed down to the man and immediately began to apologize. She said, "Please allow me to help. I'm a physical therapist and know I could relieve your pain if you'd allow." &#xa;&#xa;"Ummph, oooh, nnooo, I'll be all right...I'll be fine in a few minutes," he replied breathlessly as he remained in the fetal position, still clasping his hands together at his crotch. But she persisted, and he finally allowed her to help him. She gently took his hands away and laid them to the side, she loosened his pants, and she put her hands inside. She began to massage him. She then asked him, "How does that feel?" &#xa;&#xa;To which he replied, "It feels great, but my thumb still hurts like hell."</content>

Dr. could not identify.?</subject><content>My 6month old daughter has a rash that began under her armpits a few months ago (not bad then) and as of recently as grown down her sides and belly to her groin (not her back, arms or legs). Some areas are bright red 'blothes' while others are one 'bloth' that has grown what looks like a white head. It does not seem to bother her but when touched on her affected skin, she freezes as if it releaves her. I have researched on line and nothing explains it. We have not given her anything with wheat and use ALL Free &amp; Clear detergents. Could she all of a sudden be developing an allergy to her formula?</content>

<subject>Why is my MIL like this?</subject><content>My MIL said we when have our baby she wants to buy the crib &amp; wants my mom to go in halves with her. The problem is my mom is a single mom who is still trying to raise my 15 yr old sister &amp; she isn't making much money so she is having a hard time herself. My MIL thinks it's bad that my mom can't help &amp; she makes smart comments. When we got married my MIL was trying to say what my mom needed to pay for- I mean we are aware of the tradition where the brides's parents pay for the wedding gown, etc but if mom doesn't have the $ she doesn't have it ya know?  y mom ended up helping right much because she got her tax money.  But now, my MIL is acting the same way about the baby. I've told her before that mom is struggling but either she forgot or she don't care. If she had it she would do whatever I wanted her to because mom is a giving person. My husband's parents don't have any younger kids &amp; they own their own business so she don't understand.  How should I handle it if she starts again??</content>

<subject>my pug sounds like a stuka dive bomber?</subject><content>m reg 306 xldt, was pouring coolant down the street from the bottom of the radiator.  on the 10 minute drive to the garage it sounded like a stuka dive bomber - a real head turner, everybody watched as i chugged by.  The noise stopped before i got to the garage when the fan stopped - the car didnt overheat.  The garage changed the rad, but now say the fan doesnt work. How much are fans?  would i need to change/buy a whole assembly or can you get bits like temperature sensors and fan motors.  Changing the rad has probably cost more than this car is worth, so I dont want to spend much more.  coincidentally, does £240 seem reasonable to replace a passenger side window and change the radiator?&#xa;thanks pug knowers.</content>

I ended my very long, 5 yrs, loving relationship with GF last year b'coz of family issues, family doesnt want me to marry her. She tried convincing me a lot to come back. When family issue get resolved I came back to her after 7-8 mnths but she was unwilling to trust on me. I thought it will take some time and things will be fine. I did another mistake, after coming back I didn't call her for more than a mnth, I was trying to give her time, but she thout I did not make up my mind and she moved on and commited to some other guy. She didn't tell me while moving on.&#xa;I got to know about this and called her (we are mostly on long distance rel'n, but we had a wonderful rel'n, I'll call it a true love). Now I'm almost dead, I want her back at any rate. Bt she is not agree, she is bitching on me, per her I'm a selfish creature and don't love her. I have cleared my standings and cried over my faults and begged her to forgive me once and come back. Help me please</content>

I used to be a tomboy,a t-shirt,jeans,and chucks were my everyday outfit.I loathed carrying a bag wherever i was going,and if ever i wore a bag,it would be a sling bag,never a girly handbag.But then i guess people change,and i changed pretty drastically.I used to have frizzy,extremely poofy hair,then i changed it up,i went to this hairdresser,chopped most of my hair off,and then ironed it using straightening iron.My style totally changed,too.I wore flats and skinny jeans and leggings and started to love shopping.I guess i went from tomboy to chic.All my friends saw it in school,too.Girls started to compliment my outfit all the time and ask me where i got my stuff,and guys started treating me differently.There's this one guy i have interest on,but he acts like he doesn't seem to care. Is he playing hard to get or does he not like me?He treats me differently than all d other girls,too.I don't know..I'm trying to not like him but i can't..</content>

The question I am tryng tosolve is about the criteria to become a secret agent.&#xa;&#xa;Besides being a citizen from the country where the intelligence agency is recruiting, what other criteria is there, for example, if the agent is to infiltrate in a country like Japan? Besides having to speak the language, must he/she in this case have oriental eyes and skin colour and other physical characteristics?&#xa;&#xa;And what about the way of thinking? How does an intelligent agent has to think and how does he/she has to behave, according to that way of thinking? How does he/she has to be?&#xa;&#xa;Is there a specific way of thinking of a national kind? - example: a spy from X would think like a person living in Y and in so doing he would pass by as a citizan from Y. Is it this simple? Is this possible?&#xa;&#xa;I really would apreciate if you gave me detailed answers.&#xa;&#xa;Thank you for your help.</content>

<subject>Is this how a parrot should behave?</subject><content>An elderley lady had cared for her parrot for many years.

Aaaaaamen</content>

I don't know if it is because my mother and I have been fighting alot over stupid stuff and I just can't stand the fighting anymore, but I know when she is around we will end up in another fight. I want to and plan to go to my doctor, and I have checked out medicine information online about Xanax, Paxil, Zoloft and other drugs I could that would help with this anxiety, and Xanax seems to be the best bet; however I dont want to go to my doctor and be like "this is what I am experiencing, I want Xanax" just for the fact that he might think I'm trying to get it for no reason. Should I just go and tell him what I feel and tell him I researched several drugs and think Xanax might be best for me, or do they have tests to do this?</content>

Loved it and still do:)  &#xa;&#xa;And now i want to do the same for others..we are all are beautiful and with Mary Kay the work of trying to figure out whats really going to enhance that beauty can be done for you and with healthy vibrant skin.  &#xa;&#xa;visit http://www.marykay.com/mrshpatterson or http://www.myspace.com/mrshpatterson &#xa;&#xa;Look forward to hearing from you.</content>

God will never let us down and he or she will continue to love us through or mistakes and be proud when we fix our mistakes and be even more proud when we changes our lives completely around in a more Godly way.  God love us, and we need bad things happening on the earth because this makes us turn to God when we want feel better and also it teaches others God followers to grab those who need help and help them at all cost.  God is a God of love and smiles down on the accomplishments we make and waits patiently to realize the mistake we made and how to go about correcting them.  What do you think?  Please no insults.  I love God</content>

<subject>What does the parable of the growing seed mean?</subject><content>Mark 4:26-29  "This is what the kingdom of God is like.  A man scatters seed on the ground.  Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.  All by itself the soil produces grain--first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head.  As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come."      What does the parable mean?  What is Jesus intending to teach?  This parable has always confused me.</content>

<subject>99 camry-mileage prblems after a radiator change?</subject><content>I own a 1999 Toyota Camry (4 cyl) and recently I changed the radiator. Ever since then, my mileage has gone down. Prior to the change, I used to get around 30+ mpg on the hiway and 23-24 miles in the city. Now, I get an average of 22 miles, after filling up, and I've driven on both highway and city roads. Any suggestions as to what may have happened? and what can be done to fix this? Can something on the gas lines be messed around with? I'm thinking of talking to my mechanic but I wanted an opinion. I know there are some really knowledgeable people here. Thanks in advance for your help.</content>

<subject>God believers, if everyone was an Atheist, Is this how the world would be?</subject><content>1. No terrorist attacks&#xa;2. No klu klux klan&#xa;3. No killing of 6 million Jews(Hitler was a Christian)&#xa;4. No kiling of thousands of so called witches&#xa;5. No Religious wars&#xa;6. No George W Bush&#xa;7. No killing of millions of natives. (They started burning them alive because they refuse to accept Christianity)&#xa;8. No cruel enslavement of human beings( the bible instructs how to beat and punish slaves)&#xa;9. far less serial killers(most serial killers have strong religious upbringing)&#xa;&#xa;&#xa;1. More tax money because it would be no churches taken up space and not paying taxes&#xa;&#xa;2. less wars because they wouldn't have a god to fight about&#xa;&#xa;3.  Better lives because atheists put more value on the only life we have&#xa;&#xa;4.  Less crimes.  Why would Atheists want to spend the only life we have in jail&#xa;&#xa;5.  treating people better.  Atheists will make earth heaven because this is the only opportunity to have a REAL heaven</content>

Depressed, no, I am sort of happy, I think I just like drama in my life to enact all the negative and suppressed feelings and desires in my head.  My head!  My head.  Will I ever find romance?  I am twenty-nine years old.  I am bored of my life, I am angry, I am ashamed.  I want a pure head buzz that will sustain me day in, day out.  Can you suggest how I achieve divine union, peace of mind, joy, happiness, pure emotion and a sense of purpose of drive?  I need somebody to coach me in the right direction.  How can I improve my serious life?  Is that at all possible?  Help me feel better.  Give me some positive words.  Is there any plan for me to be lifted up into a state of bliss anytime soon?

Next thing I know, my mom calls and told me I better not even think of doing something like that and then she started calling me lol "boy" and telling me I better behave my ass.

It was my buddy's job to provide transportation on contract,  both he and his vehicle were employed by a leasing agency. He had not been paid his wages for 6 months by the customer, so he rendered the vehicle inoperable (by removing the starter) until the customer paid up the back wages.  Once he was paid, he told the customer where to find the starter and how to fix the vehicle, but he quit once he had his money.  Is he liable for any sort of crime, i.e. sabotage?  This happened 10 years ago.</content>

<subject>Can anyone relate to these symptoms while being on depo provera (bc)?</subject><content>I'm 21 yrs old. I was on depo for a little over a year and went off of it. I had little to no period, no weight  gain, no mood swings. The only thing that happened in that year is that I began bleeding during intercourse one time, luckily my bf was cool and understood what was going on. I went off of it for about a year seeing as though I wasn't getting no sex. Now I have been on it for nearly 6 mos and am experiencing some spotting and/bleeding. It happens whenever it wants to w/o warning sometimes occuring during physical exertion ie exercising, after intercourse, even sometimes when aroused. Has this happened to anyone? My doctor says it's just a coincidednce. I have had a pelvic exam and been tested for std's and everything has checked out a - okay. I would just like to know if this has happened to anyone else or should I ask a doctor for a fourth opinion (because Ive already asked 3 doctors) Also, I have tried all other forms of bc. and I dont trust condoms alone.

<subject>Why don't girls want a nice guy?</subject><content>I have often heard females saying that they want a real man to treat them like a woman. They go on to say that they desire to be treated like a queen. But why are females always attracted to men who are nothing like what they say they want in a guy and better yet, they turn down the men who will treat them with respect. Women say they want a man who has a heart, time, understanding, patience, expresses his feelings, caring, and so forth. But deny the men who demonstrates these traits, but chase after men who will never provide her  with the love she needs in a relationship.</content>

<subject>Job References: The Bad Rap?</subject><content>A few years ago I remember hearing that it was considered illegal for a previous employer to talk badly about you when someone calls for a work reference.

That they are not to "diminish" your name for a bad work experience. Is this true? What is allowed to be said, etc.? Does anyone know? THANKS</content>

<subject>Should I get a degree in Business Administration or Accounting?</subject><content>I am thinking of switching from a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology to something else due to the saturation of the IT market.&#xa;&#xa;My research indicates that Accounting is one of THE most available jobs and is also one of the highest paying non technichal degrees, much higher than Business Admin.&#xa;&#xa;My ultimate goal is to start my own business, any business. With a degree in accounting I could go on and get my MBA in accounting so that I can take the CPA exam in my state and start my own business. &#xa;&#xa;I could also get a Business Admin degree in undergrad and then an MBA in accounting and still qualify to take the CPA exam in my state and hence, still go into business for myself.&#xa;&#xa;It is a tough decision to make though. The BA degree looks easier and is very versatile, not to mention very popular at my school.&#xa;&#xa;The down side is that most jobs would benefit from a BA degree don't really require one if you have experience. Also, BA majors tend to make about 7 K less.</content>
<subject>how often should a dog recieve shots?</subject><content>My puppy (nine weeks) needs three booster shots, one month apart, which I am definintly keeping on, but I wonder how often after that is it really needed?&#xa;Some people tell me it will get too toxic if a dog or a cat recieves their shots every single year, so they get it done every 2 years instead.&#xa;My dog is, of course, going to be an outdoor dog, so I'm thinking that it would be best that he have his yearly shot.&#xa;What do you think?</content>

<subject>Equipment/Gear for Stage lighting. Experts ONLY Please. Can you help?</subject><content>I'm a sound engineer for a show band.  Recently they have been very dissatisifed, with the LIGHTING GAL.  They say she misses her cues and doesn't really bring anything but LIGHTS to the performance.  They have asked me, to perhaps write the programs, perhaps use a MIDI-FEED from my AUDIO Programs, (I'm using sonar/cakewalk) to automatically run the lights.&#xa;&#xa;I think it's a great Idea, however, although I have a good concept as to what the lighting SHOULD BE DOING, I don't have a clue as to the equipment required.  The Band has a TRUSS and SPOTS, hung from two trees.  The Lights and control board belongs to the current lighting gal, and will be leaving with her.&#xa;&#xa;Experts only - I need recommendations as to equipment, and software.

<subject>How do I shut my dog up?</subject><content>Well, just now, my neighbor called me and said that my dog hasn't shut up yet and it's 2:30 AM and he has work in the morning. I told him I'm so sorry that my dog kept him up, and so I went out to get her and bring her inside. He said thank you... I'm pretty sure she was barking all night b/c I haven't exercised her or my other dog for a couple days. My sleep schedule has been messed up. I've been tired during the day. So, anyway, I don't think I have a problem with Nighque (the one barking all night) if I just exercise her every day. But I also have a husky/chow/pit mix who HATES staying outside. He'll whine/bark constantly... So, does anyone know what I could do to shut him up when he does that. I was thinking either a tight muzzle or spray him with vinegar water when he starts up... Anymore ideas?</content>

<subject>Why does my husband hurt my feelings?</subject><content>My husband says he does not feel comfortable with one of our freind's wife. He says he cannot look at her and talk. That was last year. Last May he did not want to leave her at her house when her husband was not there. She was wearing a mini short and I could not belive why he seems well comfortable with it. Last week she started singing a love song while he is playing the guitar and he could not stop joining in. He never even look once at me but was happy singing with her. Ok I am a bad singer. But later on he kept on talking about her singing talent. I feel that he really likes her and may be love her. But why does he lie about it? I have told him before as well that the way she acts with him and vice versa makes my feelings hurt. Sometimes they keep on talking as I do not exist. So, this time I am not going to forgive him. I am sure he knows I am hurt, and he did it may be deliberately. Please let me know what to do as I feel that I cannot trust him.</content>

<subject>Do you know how to pray so that you will be heard by the Lord God?</subject><content>How to pray&#xa;Neither a Charge sheet Nor a Shopping List &#xa;Compiled By Raja Chauhan&#xa;Man has many desires - and he also possesses the ability to fulfil them. When his desires are not fulfilled, he feels utterly miserable. Although there is infinite potential in each one of us, we cannot attain all of our desires due to our own self-imposed limitations. At such times, what can man do to remove his limitations and achieve his goals? Of all methods of self-development, prayer is considered the simplest and most effective. &#xa;Many people pray, but few truly know the efficacy of prayer or how to pray. Prayer is generally misunderstood to be a charge sheet of complaints against God, or a shopping list of desires. Indeed, often our prayers are nothing more than sheer beggary. &#xa;So, what exactly is prayer? When we are unable to do something on our own, we pray in an attempt to tune in to some Higher Power. When we surrender in devotion at the altar of the All Knowing, the All Powerful and the All Compassionate, we liquidate our limited ego and the power of the Higher flows through us and helps us achieve that which seems difficult or impossible. This is the principle of invocation. &#xa;The universe is a cosmos not chaos. People may not believe in religion or theories of God. Even so, many people do feel that some Higher Power pulsates through, and guides the universe. Attune yourself to this Higher Power in whatever way you can, and visualize whatever form you like - whatever gives you peace, a sense of divinity and encouragement in your heart. &#xa;There are five essential steps in any prayer. The first is Naman (Prostration). To Prostrate is to have an attitude of humility. If we have to ask the Lord for something, then it must be done with humility. Very often, we approach the Lord with one of our many prides. Of these, the pride of the intellect is the most dangerous. Wealth, power and beauty come and go, but he who is proud of his intellect is never ready to accept his own ignorance, and thus remains proud and arrogant forever. &#xa;&#xa;The second step is Simaran (Invoking). This is to invoke the presence of the Lord in our mind or in the heart. For that Higher is not merely an idol, symbol or concept. That is a living Reality, the Absolute Truth. Call the Lord with love to listen to your prayer. &#xa;&#xa;The third step is Kirtan (Praise). Praise is never for the Lord. He does not need it. But it is only when we praise or revere someone that we are capable of surrendering our ego. It is only when we surrender our ego at the altar of love and respect that His divinity flows through us. &#xa;&#xa;The fourth step is Yaachan (Asking of Boons). We should first invoke the Lord's presence, praise Him and then ask Him for what we need. Ask not merely for things. Ask for strength, intelligence and knowledge. With only strength, we are unable to achieve much. Intelligence is also necessary. And without the right knowledge, the intellect is of little use. Having got these by the grace of the Lord - need one ask for more? &#xa;&#xa;The fifth step is Arpan (Surrender). Now that we have asked something of the Lord, should we not offer Him something in return? But what could we possibly offer the Lord that he does not already have? We should offer what we have in plenty, and that which God has none. These are the five kaleshas and the six vikaras. The kaleshas are:,. all the miseries caused by ignorance, likes, dislikes, fear of death and the ego. The vikaras are the six poisons of the mind which cause agitation - Kaam is lust, Krodh is anger, Lobh - greed, Moh is attachment, hankar is arrogance and jealousy. Offer all these to the Lord so that the Lord can take them away from you. &#xa;&#xa;Thus, in the process of praying, we should prostrate in all humility (Naman), invoke the Higher power that flows through the universe (Smaran) and sing the glories of the Lord (Kirtan). While surrendering our many weaknesses (Arpan), we may ask for our boons (Yaachan). &#xa;&#xa;Remember that </content>

<subject>Why did you go gay.  wish i was a native american back in the day.  just being alive is so confusing now adays</subject><content>yo whats up all my names alex, im 21. it was 2 years ago i had just smoked up with the kid down the hall from me, and i got back to my room and was about to go to bed when from somewhere i felt this feeling, it made me ask myself, or fear myself rather, that i might be gay.  i grew up short, girls thought i was cute.  id always get approached by girls whod say if you were a couple inches taller youd be so hot.  and it made me feel like shit.  and it made me shy.  it seems society has this definition of what a man is, and how he should treat women, and if you dont fit that, then you are gay.  you see, i know i used to love women sexually, but it seems im not a man in this country.  my mother raised me to be a very caring person, i care about peoples feelings.   i guess my question is one of deep introspection, are you gay cuz you feared that you were gay.  cuz thats why i did.  its not me but it feels right. its not what i want but i have to be it. any1 no what im talking about??wish iw</content>

How much information do they really contain about my computer?  What do they really tell the techies at Microsoft about what went wrong?  Is the information used to make patches for software?&#xa;Please do not answer just to say, "Micro5oft 5uckz so bye." That doesn't answer my question. ;-)</content>

<subject>Blondie joke (dont be offended please!! Im a blond and dont find them offensive at all....)?</subject><content>A blond walks into a department store and looks at a TV, she really, really wants to buy it and so she asks the clerk how much it is. The clerk replies&#xa;“I’m sorry Miss, we don’t serve blonds here.”&#xa;  The blond walked out disappointed and decided she could fool the sales clerk into letting her by the TV by dyeing her hair purple.&#xa;  &#xa;  So the next day the blond (err. . .’purple’) walked back into the department store and asked the sales clerk once more how much the TV cost.&#xa;“I’m sorry Miss, we don’t serve blondes here…” he replied once more. The blond went back to her place and knew that she could fool him if she dyed her hair pink. SO the next day she walked back into the department store and once again, asked the salesclerk how much the Television cost.&#xa; “I AM SORRY MISS, I’ve told you before, we don’t serve blonds here.”&#xa;“DANGIT!! How did you know it was me??”&#xa;“Well… for one thing, that’s a toaster…”</content>

<subject>Determining if a man i recently met was being friendly or had more interest in something more?</subject><content>I recently met a guy who in a one hour encounter took my breathe away. I had never met any man like him and thoughts have lingered long after our conversation. &#xa;There was something about him. I emailed him as he insisted (4 times) that i contact him for travel advice. I never received a reply so i sadly moved on.&#xa;One month later i am at a concert and i see him from a distance (all the emotions came back). He didn't see me. i told a friend and she said i should email him again. So i did and i received a reply very quickly. Turns out he had emailed me (i didn't receive) and he was pleasant and friendly in the email. I then emailed him back to say i hadn't received it. &#xa;Could he have said that to keep the network open or is he just being a nice guy as the email ended with him saying, "i hope you enjoy Japan". I feel like he is someone special but i feel cynical that maybe he was just being nice.&#xa;Should i hold out or just appreciate his help?</content>

<subject>Looking for the names of two old arcade games?</subject><content>I remember heaps of arcade games I played when I was a kid (probably circa 1985-1990) but there are two which I cannot remember the names of, but can vaguely remember the games themselves.  I'll try to describe them, and perhaps someone can figure out what they are.&#xa;&#xa;In the first, I think it was a vertical scrolling shooter of some kind, and you were piloting a plane or helicopter (I believe it could be two players at once), and you could shoot air and land enemies, but you had to watch out not to kill civilians (I remember one part where there was a long road running across the screen and I used to shoot some poor guy in his Ferrari every game).  It wasn't 1942 or 1943, but similar to these.&#xa;&#xa;The second one, I believe it was a space shooter game, and I'm pretty sure your ship was fixed in the center of the screen, and as you turned, everything turned around the center - it wasn't Asteroids, but I can't remember much else about it!&#xa;&#xa;Can anyone help?</content>

<subject>Should a parent share their abusive past with children, to help explain they're emotional problem?</subject><content>Many parents who were abused as children, find themselves dealing with emotional problems or dysfunctional behaviors when they become parents. To avoid having their children feel they are the cause, or as if they're  being rejected, certain parents will share memories of their abusive past to help the child understand them better, or to explain why they no longer have contact with past family members.&#xa;&#xa;In contrast, other parents never share their abusive past, to avoid placing emotional burdens on the child. So the child may view the parents behavior as a form of rejection, or it may leave them confused. Some children may even blame themselves for how a parent behaves when they have no other explanation.&#xa;&#xa;Which of the 2 choices do you feel is best? Would another alternative be better than either? If a parent reveals their past, what would be an appropriate age for the child? Is it a form of abuse to share painful memories of abuse with children?</content>

<subject>Ear problems?</subject><content>Ok its a long story......&#xa;I am 26, when I was 14 I had a gromit inserted into my ear to drain fluid from the middle ear.  I had my ears cleaned this morning, as I had a very sore ear and the doctor popped 4 blisters on the ear drum.  He checked the pressure of each ear and the ear that had the gromit may need a new one as I still have fluid in the middle ear.&#xa;My questions are &#xa;A) is this 'fluid in the ear' called glue ear? if not whats its medical name? &#xa;B) I am a resident of Denmark, but a citizen of the UK, how much will the operation cost in the UK, if anything?  &#xa;C) how much time will I need off work after the operation to get the new gromit?&#xa;D) I still have a little pain from the blisters, along with pain killers and the antibiotics I was given, what other ways can I get rid of the pain ie a hot water bottle or something?&#xa;Any help on any question would be realy useful, real answers only please!</content>
<subject>How do I leave abusive husband when I have gotten used to his abuse?</subject><content>I have been preparing to leave my verbally/emotionally abusive husband. He has been physical a while back in the past by choking me on 3 occasions. My mind keeps telling me to leave but my heart ends up making me stay. Despite his verbal attacks I still care for him( he also has a sweet side like he's 2 different people). When he's mean I have the confidence to leave, then he goes into sweet mode and I find it hard to gather the strength to leave. It's very confusing. I start to feel hope and we are in counseling but I think he's just going to pacify me. He tells me 'his people' are more important than me and intimidates me by screaming 1 inch away from my face( I can feel his spit). He says he doesn't care what I think or feel and that I can leave him the fuck alone  otherwise. I have gotten used to this like it's normal after almost 13 years. We have 2 small kids( boy &amp; girl). I can go live with my mom but I always feel if i stick around he will change. I'm so confused &amp; sad. I am 34</content>

<subject>Amazing fact of the Holy Book?</subject><content>In 1880, an English scientist named Henry Faulds stated in an article published in Nature that the fingerprints of people did not change throughout their lives, and that suspects could be convicted by the fingerprints they left on surfaces such as glass. In 1884, for the first time a murder was solved by means of identifying fingerprints. Since then, fingerprints have become an important method of identification. Before the 19th century, however, people most probably had never thought that the wavy shapes on their fingertips had any meaning or considered them worthy of note. &#xa;&#xa;In the 7th century, the Qur'an pointed out that the fingertips of human beings bore an important characteristic: &#xa;&#xa;Does man think that We cannot assemble his bones? Yes, We are able to put together in perfect order the VERY TIPS OF HIS FINGERS. (Surat al-Qiyama, 3-4)&#xa;&#xa;How and where did Prophet Muhammad obtain this imformation? NOBODY in his era knew the importance of fingerprint.</content>

<subject>Why does my pc continually try to load then shut down?</subject><content>Hi all, thanks for reading. My little sister was on my Dell PC a few months ago and all of a sudden it blue screened, then restarted itself. Now it only did this once, and from then I had been able to use it until a few weeks ago, when I shut it down, then tried to boot it up the next day, it wouldn't load. It would start up then cut itself off, then start up again without me even touching anything. So if anyone has any suggestions on what I could do myself to try to fix it I would really appreciate that. Thanks!</content>

She was born from extinuating circumstances; however, not a day goes by that I don't thank God for her presense in my life.

She is asking questions now, and I am not sure how best to answer her questions. She deserves to know the truth, but the truth will hurt her in the long run, I'm afraid. Is there any way to handle this situation without hurting her any more? Please let me know what advice you have.</content>

<subject>can you answer this?</subject><content>You are the ruler of a medieval empire and you are about to have a celebration tomorrow. The celebration is the most important party you have ever hosted. You've got 1000 bottles of wine you were planning to open for the celebration, but you find out that one of them is poisoned. &#xa;&#xa;The poison exhibits no symptoms until death. Death occurs within ten to twenty hours after consuming even the minutest amount of poison.&#xa;&#xa;You have thousands of prisoners at your disposal and just under 24 hours to determine which single bottle is poisoned. &#xa;&#xa;What is the smallest number of prisoners you must have to drink from the bottles to be absolutely sure to find the poisoned bottle within 24 hours?</content>

<subject>Car stolen what to do next?</subject><content>My 2001 Chrysler mini-van was stolen yesterday. I am doubtful that it will be found. We did have a loan on it since it was just bought last year. I owe just over 4k on it and the blue book value is about 6k which I assume I would get for insurance.&#xa;&#xa;I don't have the money in saving to buy a new car. I may be able to take $2k out more of a downpayment. We also have a 1996 car that will need to be replaced in 1-2 years.&#xa;&#xa;I do need a mini-van I still have 2 kids a in car seats.&#xa;&#xa;Should I buy something fairly new and keep it for years thinking about 15k or so.&#xa;&#xa;Should I buy something under $7k and then get a newer car in a few years.&#xa;&#xa;Thoughts????</content>

<subject>What about Gay Marriages and Born Gay?</subject><content>As far as homosexuals being recognized as a union between 2 consenting adults and getting all the perks a married man and women get should be good enough.  They should take Civil Unions and stop arguing for Marriage.  Marriage is religious, not Government, the Government seems to want to accept their unions, so why push for Religion to accept it too.&#xa;&#xa;As far as being born gay, what I don't understand is how so many people claim to have experimented.  Experiment for what, to see if you like being gay or not?  It seems more of a choice than a natural birth condition, and science has yet to explain how one is born gay, so....?</content>

<subject>child custody battle...........suggestions?</subject><content>Long, long story ,but after his divorce my husband tried to get custody of his 2 daughters.His ex failed 4 of 5 drug tests and had been committed to psych ward for attempted suicide b-4 custody hearing. Their party put off the court date for 2 solid years using random excuses. My husband had nothing against him except that he dated me before the divorce was finalized. She still got custody (we believe because of who she knows...her father is mayor where we live).Now 2 1/2 years later, she has been arrested for conspiracy to manufacture meth (in June) and she failed a drug test in August for THC. She also tried to overdose on xanax and went to hospital. We are finally going to custody court next week. Any suggestions about how to get around the whole mayor and judge thing? Why are courts so unfair to good fathers? The girls are now 8 and 11. They were 3 and 6 when their parents divorced. Can we win?</content>

<subject>What is the correct etiquette for people who choose to emigrate?</subject><content>When I moved from the UK to Canada (not a huge change I know) I adopted Canadian mores and values - not at the expense of my own but as a form of good manners. I learned to speak french (enough to get by) learned the anthem and did my best to fit in. I did this because I CHOSE to go to Canada and to me if a person chooses to emigrate they ought to respect the country they moved to and try to fit in. A year after I got to Canada there was riots in a suburb of Toronto as people form India protested in the streets demanding that the Canadian flag in the city hall was changed to their national flag because "there were more of them living in Brampton than there were white Canadians" yesterday I met a girl in Nottingham who could barely speak english despite the fact that she is THIRD GENERATION British. I would never ask anyone to give up their national identity but is this going too far?</content>

<subject>Why has this girl drifted from me....where did i go wrong?</subject><content>Heres the story(3weeks)...this girl, we always use to go lunch, out to movies, and even the occasional dinner/going out with friends of ours.

Her B/f did break up with her, but we use to go on lunches even before that happened. I didnt make the move cause i really didnt want to move too fast for the girl. Im so annoyed at her this past week...she doesnt respond to my txt's, unless its really urgent, and she seems to have gotten real distant from me...i have yet to ask her why, but she works with me, and i dont want to say anything yet...i really like her, and dont know what to do...One thing i noticed though, is shes really nice and laughing to everyone else...but shes now got a awkward feeling towards me everytime im there, as if she doesnt want to talk to me/ignoring me. and then we think girls arent evil?</content>

<subject>Is anyone looking for someone to (swap-bodies/vehicles with?</subject><content>Hi, to achieve the manifestation of this phenomena, both practitioners must maintain a strong, and unified will-power. The process entails "switching-lifelines." The more experience you have with out-of-body abilities, various areas of metaphysics, or with witchcraft/sorcery the better. About me? Age 26, my vehicle is handsome, and very healthy too. Anyways, I'm hoping to cross paths with my twin-flame, who will completely understand why I'm posting this. I'm a serious explorer in the realm of spirit,&#xa;and knowledge. Love is the Sacred Law, and I hold it as the key. Nearly anything can be achieved by virtue of the Sacred Law. I'm very open minded, so feel free to let me know if you have any genuine interest. I have plenty of confidence both in the Sacred Law, and in my own will-power. So, is anyone looking for someone to swap-vehicles with?</content>

<subject>Calling all Christian teenagers!  Help me out here!?</subject><content>O.K.  I want to be a good christian and still enjoy life as a teen. However, I don't have a lot of christian friends my age around. My best friends live far away from me. One of them lives in Argentina! My other dilemma is a lot of the stuff that are really cool and funny are bad or something that if Christ Himself were in my place, he would shun or be annoyed, disgusted, irritated, and sometimes, if it is real bad, He'd probably walk out the door. Also, when christians come up with their own version, for some reason, a lot of times {not all the time, but a lot of times} it 's not as captivating as that of the secular world. I mean, in terms of music { which is just ONE example}, the christian songs are beautiful! I enjoy them. However, some of the secular, not-so-religious songs are sweet, man!  According to scripture, we are not supposed to love the things of the world.  So, how do I enjoy life as teen without displeasing God? Any suggestions? ideas? survival tips?</content>

<subject>Why does my bike chain keep jumping in higher gears?</subject><content>I have a 10 speed (2x5) road bike, a French motobecane from the late 80s or the early 90s. I just got it and the first thing I did was replace the rear rim, tire, and tube.  It is all greased up.  When I am in the two highest gears the chain likes to skip/slip/jump, especially when I am pushing as hard as I can.  If I try to pedal softly and evenly it will be fine, just when I press hard.  What are some things that could be causing this?  This has a freewheel and not a cassette.</content>

<subject>Sorry, must ask.  Which one: 360, Wii, or PS3?</subject><content>X360 is out already, but already feels ancient. Halo is a great thing for the system, but that is the only great hype about it &amp; is sad.  All the other games are trite &amp; bore me. Will it melt into my carpet if left on for too long.&#xa;&#xa;Wii is soon to debut, but will I be inclined to buy it?  I love the new controller &amp; ability to dowload "older skool" games of retrolutionary history, but the surge of kidde games turns me off.  I prefer Nintendo action adventures like MP3: Corruption, Zelda: TP, &amp; Red Steel.&#xa;&#xa;As for the PS3, why is it a inflated piece of hardware?  The newest PS2 model is small &amp; sleek.  But the next-gen Sony will be  bloated like the 360.  Also, will PS3's quality beat PS2's?  I won't buy the "next best thing" if it doesn't beat its uncle. It too; will it melt if it gets too hot?</content>

Does anyone have any other suggestions?&#xa;&#xa;Also, Is there anything else that could be making my fish ill? My ammonia and Nitrate levels are low so thats not the problem....</content>

<subject>Eddie Curry for Ray Alsotn??</subject><content>I am in a stat fantasy league and I am in need of Assists.  The best deal I've gotten so far is Ray Alston who is averaging 4.5 per game (granted he had a game with 14).  The guy was looking for a forward with points and I wasn't going to give him any of my starters so I offered Eddie Curry.  Curry is only getting 18 a game (vs. Alston's 14) and the other relevant stats are the same.  He is willing to take Curry since Curry qualifies as a Center-Forward.  Since I am not using Curry and am in desperate need for Assists, does this look like a decent deal or am I giving up too much for an Assist guy?</content>

<subject>USMC deserter living abroad is thinking about going public with story.?</subject><content>After graduation I deserted, and have been living in various countries abroad. A drill instructor was physically abusing some of the recruits and was clearly disciplining certain recruits for reasons which clearly reflected personal spiteful intentions. One recruit, who graduated, was a habitual bed-wetter whom everybody, including the the drill instructors, were aware of. During training the recruits were coerced into lying and not reporting illegal or immoral activities taking place, which had to be reported to both the officers and non-commissioned officers in charge. The senior drill instructor instructed recruits to modify our weapons, by cutting the recoil springs shorter, in order to improve our overall platoon shooting range scores. Modifying federal property is a federal offense, yet our superiors instructed us, as they previously had, to not report such violations. I reported these activities; yet it became clear these issues would be swept under the rug. Do not enlist.</content>

<subject>I have hit peri-menopause and can not lose weight - HELP!?</subject><content>Last year, around August I went on a diet and exercise program of my own.  I got down to 126lbs.  I then went on medication in Feb 06, and started to gain weight.  I started going to the gym and working out, yet still the weight grew.  We had a 'biggest loser' contest in work from July - Sept, and every week, despite eating smaller meals more frequently, and going to the gym about 4 times per week, I still continuted to gain weight.  Then I found the medication I was on could cause weight gain, so I came of that in August.  From September, I have been going to the gym at 5.30am before work, five days a week.  I work out on the Eliptical for about 45 mintues, trying to keep my heart rate in the wieght loss zone.  My husband has also been working out.&#xa;Since August he has lost 13lbs, he eats more than me.&#xa;I have gained 1 lb.&#xa;Don't tell me it's muscle, been there, talked to the gym instructer, had the measurements taken - It's FAT.&#xa;Been to the doctor, no luck. Clothes are tighter. HELP</content>

Will he be there always and frovever? I don't care about how fency or dreamy the wedding might be, I care of what happens after that, should i take the risk and go for it??????????</content>

Can it be done independent of the master tapes?</subject><content>For the audio engineer/experts: Is it possile to "remaster" an album WITHOUT the master tapes (I have heard the AJFA original masters where lost or destoyed). With modern digital edititing, can sound layers be extracted and tweaked? For example, taking the minute (discreet) bass track and relayering it. Basicially achieve the same results as if you had access to master recordings. Also, can destuctive harmonics be fixed (there are 3 occurances on AJFA). I assume the "bone  dry" overall sound cound be wet and decompressed?</content>

He recently wanted me to do something to his computer while he was at work. I went to the "Documents" on start to look for the file he requested and bumped into a picture called "Girls" anyway (I know I shouldn't of looked not my computer) but it was a nude girl who was about 8 or 9 maybe. This really shocked me, I continued to see if he downloaded other images like that maybe on accident (meaning he accidently downloaded a 8 year old girl picture instead of older women) He had various pictures of women though but also of children....... which kind of sickens me. I am not sure what am I to think =/. I am thinking of just ignoring it and moving out next year when I am out of high school because this is kind of creepy. Any ideas? Also unless this starts to become a real problem (IE he tries to get with a underage girl) then I am not contacting the police.</content>

<subject>How Should I handle this Situation?</subject><content>I need some good solid advice for what to do in this situation as it keeps happening to me at this technical, non customer service job.&#xa;We have SOP’s (Standard Operating Proceedure – basically directions), we are told to follow the SOP's and in fact make 'mistakes' that the managers bring to our attention if we do not follow these SOP's.&#xa;Tonight, I had a situation where I followed an SOP and as soon as I was done I was told by the 'lead', who functions as my supervisor so they only have to have one manager,  "You cannot just blindly follow SOP's! You should ask!". I was told this because about a year ago, before I was here, an email came to this person saying to deviate from the SOP. I would not have gotten this email, and the SOP was never updated, there was also no way to know now to follow it. I have been told by managers that I must follow the SOP's, and I have been told by co-workers it is always best to follow SOPs as you cannot get into trouble for it.&#xa;So, I cannot follow them without asking, I cannot not follow them, it is not feasable to ask about 300 times a shift if it is ok to do what the SOP says to do.&#xa;This happens at least once a week with this person, and I have been at the job less than 3 months. I am basically in a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation and I am not sure, after 15+ years in the corporate world how to handle this particular situation. So - what would you do, aside from finding a better job, in this situation? &#xa;I need some advice on how to handle this person when they being talking to me like I am a particularly stupid child who has to have a reminder note to breathe because that is how they speak to me every time this happens and then they get upset because I naturally mirror people (trust me, it is not a good instinct in this case!)</content>

I kinka think that it wasnt his choice his parents are both atheist and i have met them a few times and there are really strict. Sometimes kids talk to him about it and they wil make a joke and he ussaly laughts and pretends not to care. I tryed to invite him to a bible study that i do with alot of my friends and i tryed to convince him to come and just eat breakfast and not preasure him or anything but he wouldnt come. So im not really sure what to do i feel like i should at least try or something but i dont know what to try cause if i feel like im making him do something and its obviously not working. Should i let him decide forhimself i think if he gave it a chance even if he didnt become a christian and stayed atheist at least i know he gave it a try and isnt doing it becuase of his parents</content>

I have been hurt by it and have even been seeking help for it. I have been told that everyone has their own ideas of what an affair is.

I just want to know I am not the only one out there and that there really are people that think like me. If you think this is stupid or just can't understand that porn can hurt someone this badly read my blog. I have been writing in it lately almost everyday and is only for me dealing with this kind of pain.

Why would a letter like the following not get published in the Toronto Star?  It raises an issue of conscience regarding our taxes, and directs attention to the life of a truly brave woman who deserves a lot more publicity than TomKat's recent wedding.  For how long do the Zionists think they can get away with controlling news?&#xa;&#xa;Dear Sir&#xa; &#xa;Re: War of words (November 18)&#xa; &#xa;I am baffled as to why the play My Name Is Rachel Corrie should be considered controversial.  Here's a woman who was bulldozed to death in yet another routine act of crime against humanity by the state of Israel.  What should be controversial, and in fact explored, is the silence by our media and acquiescence by our government at such immence atrocities by this terrorist nation.

I have been posting all kinds of questions about my progress with my pregnancy...(thinking i might go early and such) but the past two weeks i have been having lots of menstrual like cramps...they started right after i lost my mucous plug (w/o any blood in it) ....monday my cervix was thinning...today i am a fingertip dilated....also i was checked on the monitor in L&amp;D since we thought my water broke (and it did not) and they said i was indeed having some contactions (this was also monday)...well today the cramps are not so bad that i can not walk, but they are making it so hard for me to focus, and i am getting moody because i am so uncomfortable. Does anyone know if it sounds like i am going into labor. Or have any of you had cramps that made it hard to focus w/o actually being in labor...how long were your cramps making you uncomfortable before you actually went into labor</content>
<subject>what have i gotten myself into now?</subject><content>I have known this guy through mutual friends for probably about 8 mths now. This past wkend we ran into eachother, out with our mutual friends, and ended up spending the rest of the evening together. And, the next evening &amp; the next evening.we have this extreme attraction to eachother.i don't even know how to explain it? It's more than lust,it's a "connection" I can't stop smiling when i'm around him, and i get butterflies when i know i'm going to see him. I feel like i'm in highschool all over again, and the crazy thing is, he feels all the same things. It's not like we're 25 yrs. old..we are both way beyond playing games. I'm 32, and he's 39. Here's the dilema. I've been in a off/on relationship for about 2 yrs. now, and we have been real rocky lately, that's probably why i persued, well, not persued, but am so taken with this other man. I'm floating..I know my relationship is over but don't know what i'm getting myself into? Is this 2 good to be true? Should i be concerned?</content>

<subject>How do I remove dental adhesive from mine and my daughter's teeth?</subject><content>My husband lost his job a few months ago and I could not afford to continue paying for mine and my daughter's braces. My daughter even had wires that were broken but the orhtodontist's office said that I had to pay what I owed before they would take them off. Well that is about $2400. If I could afford to pay that I would be able to afford our monthly payments. Needless to say, I had to remove our braces myself because I had no other choice. There is still adhesive on our teeth and I can't get it off. Does anyone know how I can get it off? I am desperate! Please help!</content>

<subject>Should we know the difference between right and wrong?</subject><content>DIVINE ENERGY  If we live by Jesus example then we will be promised heaven. Is heaven a place that we know from the efforts of our actions that attracts god. For instance have you ever noticed a negative person be sick constantly and attract negative people would this experience be considered hell? And the positive ones who always do good to people, and get good back would this be considered heaven.  Is heaven with judgement or without it?&#xa;Now think about this Man ate the apple knowing now the difference between good and evil. He knew this becasue now he was able to judge the nakedness of himself as being shameful.  If man did not know he was naked then he had no judgement to place upon himself to know.</content>

I don't eat breakfast in the mornings, and my Mom's always like you're starving yourself, and my friends are always telling me that I don't eat enough.......  I'm just not hungry in the mornings, I've told my Mom that, but she says I need to keep my body going and jumpstart my metabolisim.  I think that maybe she has a point but I don't get hungry, am I going to gain weight or lose weight if I don't eat breakfast? Am I not eating enough.

<subject>Pregnancy/ Miscarriage Question...any answers would be appreciated?</subject><content>My husband and I are trying to get pregnant. We started trying in October and as of right now I'm 9 days late, however I took a home pregnancy test and it came back negative. I'm pretty sure I ovulated in October and usually a menstrual cycle will follow ovulation unless you're pregnant. Now this is where my question falls in place....About a week or two ago I had some pregnancy symptoms but they seemed to disappear. I also experienced extreme abdominal pain that lasted about 2 hours, and it was to the point where I was bending over in pain and had my husband drive to the nearest hospital. After popping an Aleve and spontaneously, after arriving at the hospital, the pain seemed to go away, so I never stayed long enough at the hospital to get checked out. So my question is, if I'm not pregnant, do you think I had a very early miscarriage? The weird part is I never bled or had any spotting what-so-ever. Ever since that experience, I've been fine. What do you think? Please help, Thanks</content>

<subject>Is it true that the Western parents aren't as "good" as what we think?</subject><content>I'm an asian guy and to tell you the truth we used to scold or even beat our kids sometimes but not to the level of being an abusive parents but one thing for sure we never ground our kids no matter what sort of mischieves they've done in the past.We believe that parents should let their kids own their freedom to do whatever they want to do or wherever they want to go.I heard that Many American parents opposed any sort of child beating because they believe it could led to abuse yet at the same time they tend to ground their kids at home just for a simple causes like failing in school test,did'nt finish thier homework,skipping classes,involved in fights and so on.When the kids were grounded,there will be no pocket money,no summer holidays,no outdoor games and many more restrictions.This grounding i heard can continue up to a month.I'm very sorry if these stamements do upset some of the parents out there but i think this is very opressive.What do you guys think about issue?Any comments</content>

<subject>Pretty weird social anxiety symptom?</subject><content>When I'm watching tv and a female suddenly appears on it, I get anxious. I can't breathe normally, and sometimes my body jerks momentarily. But it occurs only when there are people who are watching tv with me and they are close to me enough to see my body jerk or breathe abnormally. I think my anxiety is due to the fact that it embarrasses me that, if I look anxious when looking at females, others may know that I'm sensitive about women because I get shy when talking to a female or because I don't have a gf. I try not to be conscious about it, but it's hard. You may wonder why it's such a big deal, but I just feel like a total loser everytime I'm sure someone found it out. What will help me get out of this? Any piece of advice would be appreciated.</content>

She has been admitted to hospital twice in 12 month, I think for overdosing, and after a few weeks of their care is sent back home. He will not allow the family to see her without causing a fuss and the strain is now telling. When the Social Services are informed they say that unless the mother raises the alarm there is nothing the family can do???? If a child is under threat is this the same reaction????Does anyone have the answer????</content>
<subject>How many calories should I intake daily to get to a healthy weight?</subject><content>I'm a girl, 16 yrs. old, 5'6'', and 100 lbs. I guess I'm anorexic and I'm so afraid of getting fat. How many calories should I intake daily to obtain a healthy weight? But I really need a good diet plan that doesn't make me feel guilty about the food I'm eating or otherwise, sadly, I'll guilt myself into throwing it up. Plus, a good exercise plan would be great. Two years of anorexia with tendancies of bulimia really does literally eat away at your muscles ans sometimes they even give out on me. please help.</content>

This is the first time I’ve every tried something like this but it sounded interesting because Maggiano’s is one of our favorite restaurants.  We are planning a 65th birthday party for my Mom on October 1st.  The gift card was for this purpose.  Anyway, the gift card was either for $150.00 or $200.00.  I had to fill out a long survey and since that day I have received many emails in my bulk folder (which I delete but they obviously got my name from the survey). I expected that to happen but I still have not received a gift card via email (to print) or a hard card at my home address.&#xa; &#xa;I contacted the banquet manager at Maggiano’s (since she is the only person I know there and she is helping me with Mom’s party) and she didn’t know anything about it.

<subject>People: Lazy or Just Plain Stupid?</subject><content>Why is it that people find it easier to ask people relatively simple questions and wait around for a couple of hours until somebody stumbles across their question instead of just searching for it themselves?  Obviously some of the people that come on here aren't the brightest of creatures due to their complete lack of forming even the simpliest of questions.  Now some questions I can understand, for example if a person is asking about a products performance, for a quick survey of people's opinions, thoughts, or beliefs, or some other varint of the above mentioned examples.  But someone asking a question like, "How does one say one in Spanish?"  If you have the internet, then perhaps you should use more websites then just Yahoo! or MySpace.

<subject>Question for Christians?</subject><content>What do you think the number 666 stands for? Also what are your opinions on Revelations 20:1-3? I don't know why but I am really interested in these three verses. "And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key to the Abyss and holding in his hand a great chain. He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil or satan, and bound him for a thousand years. He threw him into the Abyss, and locked and sealed it over him, to keep him from decieving the nations anymore untill the thousand years were ended. After that, he must be set free for a short time."&#xa;&#xa;When do you think the thousand years is? Do you think it has already happened or in the future? Are we in the middle of it right now? Were do you think the Abyss is ? Do you think it is the one in space?</content>

<subject>Is this what typically happens when you convert from Islam to another religion?</subject><content>October 20, 2006: The dead body of Dr. Mehaboob, the missionary of At Anycost Jesus Mission in Pakistan found in Neelum river on October 18. He was 42 years of age. Two of his children Shalom and Sharon were brutally murdered and the dead bodies were burnt on 1st of September. His wife Paulin Mehabooba (37 years old) and the youngest daughters Sherin (11 years old) and Shelvin (7 years old) are still missing. &#xa;&#xa;Dr. Mehaboob was a Muslim. He was born in Bahawalpur in Pakistan. He accepted Jesus Christ as his personal saviour while he was studying. He married a christian girl named Paulin about 17 years ago. His conversion and marriage created problems. They would have been killed by his relatives. But they escaped and lived in Peshawar for few years. &#xa;&#xa;Dr. Mehaboob was approached by certain of the muslem community and commanded to convert back to Islam. When he refused, his eldest son was kidnapped and circumcised as a warning.</content>

<subject>Does anyone remember the Montreal Screwjob?</subject><content>I remember watching the match(Survivor Series 1997-Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels) live and thinking that something wasn't right. &#xa;1. The camera cut to Shawn instead of Bret, who was put in the hold. Normally, the camera is angled at the wrestler in the hold so the fans can see him give up. &#xa;2. Bret's shock after the bell was rung. I'm not sure Michaels shock was legit or not. &#xa;3. Shawn looking pissed after being just given the belt that he won. For me, it was fishy b/c the winner would look like he is on top of the world so to speak not pissed off.&#xa;4. Bret spitting at Vince before the cameras turned off ending the show. At least for me, Bret's destroying the monitors or him waving WCW were not shown. &#xa;&#xa;I have it taped and am still stunned to this day, b/c wrestling was always shown as fake and here is something that really happened. I'll remember this till the day I die.&#xa;&#xa;How did you guys react?</content>

<subject>I cannot believe how irate I am at hearing this response.  Looking for outside/un-biased input.?</subject><content>I have a (almost) five year old lil' girl.  Her father and I split up when she was three.  If it wasn't for her I wouldn't mind if he fell off the face of the earth in any matter concerning me but my girl loves her daddy and I don't have any inclination to deprive her of him.  I don't talk badly about him in front of her.  I maintain a civilized, polite attitude when all 3 of us are together.  I even invited him to go with us to her 1st time at Disneyland on my b-day.  He has given me every reason and more to dislike, distrust &amp; lose any respect I ever had for him.  There are no custody "bindings" in place, yet.  I told him I had a concern about not knowing where he lives (therefore where my daughter lives when she's w/ him) except that it's quite close.  If there were some kind of accident I wouldn't know how to get there.  He replied it's not an issue.  WHAT?!?!

<subject>Why do men "come back" to me?</subject><content>I am a woman who has had few successful relationships in my past. This is only because in my past, I have seeked out a long-term relationship, not a short-term that could end in a month or so. All of the men I've casually dated are great and we have a great time, but they've always seemed to "change their mind" about me and move on. It ends up being short-term. HOWEVER, weeks, sometimes months pass and they ALWAYS come back saying they've just "thought" about me, or they made a mistake. By the time they've 'come back,' I've moved on to something (or someone) else. I just want to know why men do this? It seems as though they change their mind and want me back. Like i said, we have a great time together at the time, then they get cold feet. Are men as fickle as I think they are? Do they just get scared? Ladies, has this happened to you?</content>

<subject>What can I POSSIBLY do about my acne?</subject><content>I am so fed up with my skin.  I don't know what to do anymore.&#xa;&#xa;Before college, my skin was okay.  I had some breakouts and redness, but overall, nothing to be too embarrassed about.&#xa;&#xa;Since the day I started college, it's been a nightmare.  I have breakouts that just grow and grow.  They get worse and worse.  I drink a lot of water.  I eat a balanced diet.  I wash my face and moisturize twice a day.  I've tried Proactiv in the past and it cleared me up a little bit but made my skin so flakey and dry that I had to stop.  (Which is another thing -- it will dry up for no apparent reason and starts to flake and feel tight... it's awful.)  I started using a Clindamicin (sp?) cream I had once used, and it made my pimples HUGE by the next morning.  I've used Clean &amp; Clear, Basis, Neutrogena, and Cetaphil... nothing.&#xa;&#xa;My stress level is about the same as it was in high school (a moderate level, I'd say), and it was never this bad.  I don't touch my face a lot.&#xa;&#xa;I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ANYMORE</content>

<subject>Why is hate so strong within the american culture?</subject><content>Exploring yahoo answers, the web, the news, etc... I see hate being acted upon and promoted by many of different backgrounds.  I see Michael Richards expressing hate on TV, I see an african american college professor saying kill all the whites, I see non-believers of a religion attacking the the believers, I see the believers of that same religion attacking the others.  The thing that bothers me is that all the hate is stereotyped to a certain group, not directly to one person.  Not that I promote hate towards anyone, but I have been taught to live by the Golden Rule.  But why are there so many that are uncivilized in their interactions with each other?  (Please no answers that stereotype a certain group, religion, or race)</content>

<subject>Is it impossible for me to get energy from sleep if I have Restless Leg Syndrome?</subject><content>A couple of months ago, I was diagnosed with having Hypersomnia and am currently taking 350mg of Provigil, which has worked exceptionally well to keep me awake during class, work, etc. . After further reading of hypersomnia, I had realized Restless Leg Syndrome was the cause. Ever since I was about six, I've had the symptoms of RLS: tingling feeling, urge to move, only goes away when moving or concentrating on something else like video games. The thing is, it occurs to almost ALL of my muscles not just legs or arms, but my neck, fingers, shoulder, calves, etc. I wake up in the morning just the same way I went to sleep. I feel like I get no energy at all from sleep. What am I supposed to do?? I also haven't had the time to check in with my neurologist lately, but plan to do so soon for asking about RLS. What can I do sleep-wise to help me? Also dietary?</content>

Especially for biodiesel, current fuel costs strongly depend on feedstock costs; in total fuel costs, this SHARE may be as high as 60-70 per cent. For bioethanol this SHARE is much lower, depending on the feedstock used. However, in the US, biodiesel is generally farther from competitive prices than is ethanol.</content>

This is god's personality&#xa;&#xa;God Will Kill Ethiopia  &#xa;&#xa;    "You Ethiopians will also be slaughtered by my sword," says the LORD.  And the LORD will strike the lands of the north with his fist.  He will destroy Assyria and make its great capital, Nineveh, a desolate wasteland, parched like a desert.  The city that once was so proud will become a pasture for sheep and cattle.  All sorts of wild animals will settle there.  Owls of many kinds will live among the ruins of its palaces, hooting from the gaping windows.  Rubble will block all the doorways, and the cedar paneling will lie open to the wind and weather.  This is the fate of that boisterous city, once so secure.  "In all the world there is no city as great as I," it boasted.  But now, look how it has become an utter ruin, a place where animals live!  &#xa;&#xa;about me http://www.listentocharlie.com</content>

<subject>Does drinking of water before having food, improve digestion or it dilutes digestive enzymes?</subject><content>When you drink lots of water (Say 500 ml) before having food, is it good or bad?&#xa;I have two opinions with explanations.&#xa;&#xa;Good - the water dilutes enzymes. Thus the digestion (chemical reaction) takes place in a soft manner i.e., no gas is released!&#xa;&#xa;Nod Good - The water dilutes the digestive juices and hence the digestion is affected due to the lack of concentrarion of enzymes!&#xa;&#xa;Can you guys please tell me which is correct?</content>

<subject>What's going on?</subject><content>A man arrived home from work to find absolute chaos. As he walked up the garden path he fell over toys, strewn all over the gound and a broken milk bottle on the doorstep. Inside, the living room was in uproar. The two small children had up-ended the furniture and pushed over the television. The carpet had food all over it plus an overturned vase of flowers and spilt glasses of milk. The kitchen was even worse. Dirty dishes, covered every work surface, the fridge had been left open so it had de-frosted and the cat was sitting on the table eating left-over food.&#xa;&#xa;"Oh no!" he gasped, turning white. He was really worried that something had happened to his wife. He raced up the stairs, two at a time and rushed into the bedroom. There, sitting up in bed was his wife, reading a book and eating chocolate. :)&#xa;&#xa;"What's going on?" he asked. "I thought you must be ill."&#xa;&#xa;"Oh no," she replied, "but when you come in every day and ask me what I did......WELL, TODAY I DIDN'T."</content>

<subject>Question about a girl who is WAAAY to clingy??</subject><content>I’m 28 and I've worked at my job for about six months now. Another girl, Alisha, started the same time. She is a very nice girl, always friendly and upbeat. Her problem?&#xa;She doesn't know how to stop talking. From the minute she enters the break room, she'll go on and on and on and on and on and on about EVERYTHING-- food, family, shopping, weather, you name it. She barely breathes! And she doesn't seem to understand when it's inappropriate, or what's inappropriate to talk about. For example, sometimes I choose to sit by myself at lunch and read, simply because I'm tired and I need some alone time to refresh. She'll come and sit by me and talk non-stop until the end of my lunch hour. Yes, the entire hour. I don't know where she comes up with so much stuff to say. Other times I'll put my head down on the table to take a quick nap during my lunch hour and she'll walk in, drop her stuff across from me at the table, sit down, and start talking. She's a bottomless pit. She never runs out of stuff to say. &#xa;Slowly, over time, I’ve tried VERY hard and have pretty much learned to look past her nonstop mouth. Underneath she’s such a nice person. But even so, I still cringe when she comes in the room because I know there won’t be one more moment of peace until she leaves.&#xa;Here’s another problem (and sorry this is so long). She asked me for my phone number, and I didn’t want to give it to her because I knew she’d call me and I’d probably never get off the phone again. So I told her I don’t give out my phone number. This didn’t deter her; she looked it up in the phone book. Now she calls me EVERY SINGLE DAY. Actually, she skipped one day. And when she calls she still goes on and on and on, talking about EVERYTHING, including sex and other things I don’t want to know about… I cringe now whenever the phone rings because I know it’s her. Twice I’ve decided not to pick up the phone, and she proceeded to call back SIX TIMES IN ONE HOUR!!&#xa;I tried telling her that she doesn’t need to call me every day, and that’s when she didn’t call me for that one day. Then again tonight, here’s the phone call again. I let the answering machine get it. Then she called back AGAIN! Like I had somehow materialized within the two minutes between the two phone calls!&#xa;WHAT do I do to STOP all this???? I’m just about the only person at my job (there are around 350 of us there) who can do more than tolerate her. She’s gotten in trouble a bunch of times already for saying inappropriate sexual things in the break room, yelling “HI!!!” to people who are working 7 cash registers away, and other things too. I’m starting to wonder if she has a real psychological or physiological problem and she really CAN’T stop talking. She told me her mom has Schizophrenia, so I’m wondering if her inability to realize how obsessively she’s talking could be some form of mental illness too…?&#xa;Any comments or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I’m almost at the end of my rope.&#xa;Thanks for taking the time to read all this.</content>

<subject>What should I get him for Christmas?</subject><content>There is this guy that I like, and he likes me too.  The problem with this is that we don't really talk to each other very much.

<subject>You have been cheated  - how will you react?</subject><content>He was a smooth talking conman. Met him by introduction. He showed documents purportedly for his successful tender for some works. Said he didn't have the capital to get started - would I come up with the money and be his equal partner? Then I gave him first  some thousands bucks, then some more thousands before he did the disappearing act.  Met some friends who told me I had become victim of a famous local conmen. Well, I know his house, wife and kids. I called him on his mobile phone and literally shouted " Two types of person who must be gotten rid of  are thieves and conmen like you. You will not answer my call, and you will instruct your wife to tell me you are out-station  and she she doesn't know where, or when you'll be back. Those are typical conmen trick. But you can't run away. Either you  give back my money or you will be dead, or something else will befall you."He kept his promise to pay back by instalments. How will you deal with conmen if you have been victimised?</content>

<subject>Whats 'progressive' about leftists?</subject><content>Leftists economic doctrines are absolutely proven to be outright failures (see Hiyak vs Keyes debate). Among educated people and the entire community of Economists, there is absolutely no question about the total and complete doom and certain failure inherent in almost all leftists economic positions.&#xa;&#xa;Given this FACT, what in the hell could be 'progressive' about the left? I concede some positions on social issues, but in my esitmation, leftist dogma has much higher 'fundamentalist odor' to it than the even the zaniest Pat Roberston follower.&#xa;&#xa;I see religion as a problem, but I dont see religion in the narrow way leftist media otufits want me to see it. Why should I prefer a Leftist Zealot to a Baptist Fundy? Seriously...think about that? When you think about it, the idea of God is a tiny, almost insignificant detail.&#xa;&#xa;Fundies have religious books...that it? LOL...distinguish that from absolute starry eyed reverance leftists have for Marx's Manifesto...please...</content>

<subject>Sushi is NOT light and delicate?</subject><content>Last month, I asked the question on here: "What is the big deal with Sushi? Especially when it comes to girls and dating?", and the common response that I got (especially from girls) was that it was "light and delicate." I didn't think that this was the case, so I went to a nice Sushi Bar in Visalia, CA (Tokyo Garden to be exact) with some friends from work, and I tried some Sushi (for the first time ever in my life) to see for myself. I had a California Roll (which was really good), and a Sushi plate that consisted of 3 different kinds of raw fish on top of rice (which was very nasty). Anyway, I can tell you all right now that it was NOT light and it was NOT delicate. For example when I ate one piece of the California Roll, it was like I was eating a 3 course meal all at once, in one bite! As for the other dish, it was so much food that I couldn't finish it all. Anyway, those girls were wrong, but it seems that all girls and women in general like all things light and delicate. Right?</content>

<subject>Experienced Dog Breeders or Vets......I need some explanation on why this happened?</subject><content>My dog had puppies on Nov. 20...delivery was successful. Saturday, a week later, I noticed a puppy not doing so well and wasnt gaining weight like the others. Would not latch on to a teet, so I started warming him and gave some Karo Syrup to pep him up. I then stomach tube fed him a few times every 3 hrs. and started nursing on his own. He was doing fine. Would watch him closely and make sure he was getting his share of milk since the others had an advantage over him cuz of their size. I was weighing them and even that puppy was putting weight on. I thought excellent.. on the road to recovery...WRONG. I noticed he would latch on but wasnt really sucking..just falling asleep so I gave some karo to pep him up. That didnt work and he was getting chilled so I warmed him up, remind you these dogs are in my house in a whelping box (room temp. 80 degrees) w/a heating mat in the corner. I then stomach tube fed him and then 3 hrs later did it again.</content>

<subject>Whats wrong with my dads attitude?</subject><content>I always stay home and MOST teenagers in our city go out all the time to hang with friends etc. I spent the weekend at my families house in sacramento and when i came back my dad says "All you do is go out, youre never home all that youre interested in is going out and not being home". I have never ever went out through out my entire 16 years of life with friends to go out. I dont even have them come over! I dont even TALK ON THE PHONE WITH THEM!  Hes always saying that i do this and that, but its always the opposite. He says i spend my money on dumb stuff, I usually some more than half so i can have money when i need it. He says something everyday that gets all of my brothers and sisters so angry but we dont say anything. Does he act like this because my mom isnt living with us anymore? Or because whenever we go out he never goes, he just stays home and watches t.v. My sister and brother are younger than me and we never talk to him. Just once or twice a day were not close AT ALL!</content>

<subject>Help! I need some serious advice!?</subject><content>Ok heres my problem. Ive been with this guy for 3yrs and weve got 1 child together.Ive got 2 from a previous relationship. &#xa;The man that Im dating was on probation and told me that once he was off he'd move closer so that we could see each other more etc. Hes been off probation since September and is making plans to get an apartment where he is now and wants the kids and I to move there. The problem is hes in the USA and Im in Canada and I don't want to move there,which hes known since the beginning. He also said that I could get a job and work under the table so the government doesnt know(Im not doing that). &#xa;Weve had lots of arguements in the past and it also seems like he likes to make me feel guilty about things...&#xa;For example: If he calls and Im not home he leaves a message saying that 'hes not wasting more time on his calling card to call me and I hope Im happy cuz I made him waste time on it'..&#xa;Also I can't go out even with friends cuz he gets kinda mad and jealous.</content>

<subject>How can I get rid of anxiety and my panic attacks?</subject><content>Hi.  I have been suffering from panic disorder for almost a year. It is work related. I was bullied at work and as a result I got moved to another area. But its not the job for me and I cant cope anymore. I have started to look for another job.&#xa;Im ok until the day before Im back at work and then try not to think about it. But it is always at the back of my mind.  I have panic attacks, usually when Im on my own, but my husband saw me for the first time having a really bad one last week. I feel so low and guilty, because I think my anxiety is too much for my husband. He shouldnt have to see me like this.  I hate being on my own now, especially at night. And I cant sleep the night before Im working. Once Im there Im exausted and constantly worry away to myself. I have even thought about taking a heap of pills or cuttting myself - just so I dont have to go to work. But I wouldnt manage to do either of things cos I know that that would make everything worse.  Im seeing a councillor.</content>
<subject>Is it legal to determine a person's financial eligibility by appearance?</subject><content>There is a program called Give the Gift of Sight at LensCrafters that gives glasses to low income people.  I went to get a pair recently.  After my first appointment, I recieved a phone call saying my appointment was cancelled because I looked too "rich".  I had brought in my own frames to use and I was told that was the reason they thought I had money.  I called the manager and she apologized.  She said she trains her employees to determine the financial eligibility of clients by their appearance, not financial records.  This sounds very strange to me, even discriminatory and could be illegal.  Does anyone know if this is illegal and what law it could violate?</content>

<subject>If you have been through this--please help!?</subject><content>I've got this male friend who I've know for about 2 yrs.  He has been coming over my husband and my house for about a yr.  He just got married 3 mos.ago.  He didn't tell me, a friend did.  He then told me he forgot-he said that he married her because of their 12 yr old--he lived with her 12 yrs--she cheated on him 2 yrs ago--He said that he isn't in love with her, doesn't trust her, and they have nothing in common.  I've been married for 18 yrs--never been unfaithful--I'm in love with our friend--he doesn't know because I've never told anyone.  Sometimes I think that he feels the same by the way he looks at me--but he doesn't express himself emotionally at all, so I have no idea--How can you know if someone cares about you if they never voice it?  Some days he's very caring, and others I feel like he brushes me off---please help--How can I know if he cares? and second How can I get over him when he is all I think about--I'm hurting very much inside --any advice</content>

How does voting work? Do we all get the same list and we can vote for who we want or do you tell "them" what side we are on and they give us that sides list?  &#xa;I hope I haven't confused anyone.

<subject>Married seven years. Thinking I should FILE for divorce. Need thoughts!!!?</subject><content>I am repeating because some people didn't get the questions. This is not about reconciling. This is about whether to FILE now or not. &#xa;Everyone I talk with about this has an agenda so I am asking complete strangers for neutral thoughts on this issue. Wow!&#xa;Should I file for divorce or are the benefits worth it?&#xa;If I file, I lose all health insurance, life insurance and pension rights if something happens to him. He is now paying the mortgage (almost $2000) and all of the tuition for the two kids ($1800) without an argument. He left me and is involved with another woman so it feels that by not filing I am saying that it is OK. My son has cerebral palsy. One marriage is enough so I am not looking to marry again. Any thoughts? &#xa;&#xa;I would like to hear from people with experience. Thanks</content>

Is this true, and if so, what is "very easily"???  I also have heard that they "freeze up" as well.  What would be the cause of this?

<subject>Auto Insurance. I filed a claim with Bristol West.?</subject><content>How long does it take to for them to respond and fix my car. I have a lowered Honda Civic, the whole front end and bumper got ripped off because I had pulled up to far in my parking stall at my apartment complex. It screwed the whole front end up, jacked up a tail light, but the car is still drivable. There were no other vehicles involved., no injuries, no property dmage other then mty vehicle.  Does this sound like it can be covered. I have had a dispute with my apartment complex over why I did not want a concrete bumper on in my parking stall, plus my parking stall is on a steep incline, making it so that I have to pull up alot so my car is not half in and half out of the stall. I feel that this is the property management's fault because it is the second time that damage has been done to my car by this. I had to park my car nearly 100 feet away from my stall in guest parking for the longest time because of it.</content>

My mum is messed up in the head, when I was 13 she introduced me to a 21 year old drug dealer, she wants me to mess up deep down although she wont admit it, just because she did.&#xa;But the thing is, i cant get this guy out of my head. I think i love him and its scary. I know the complications and its not an ideal situation and we are both sworn to secrecy but he seems to be going off me even though he says he is always here for me and I dont know what to do.

<subject>Imagine a world without France... Is it possible?</subject><content>For centuries scholars have pondered the problem of France - trying to balance their hatred of France with their natural reluctance to destroy a whole country and all of its inhabitants. &#xa;&#xa;In recent years the problem has been resolved: By smashing their heads repeatedly against hard, gravelly surfaces, the scholars discovered that the more pain that they were in, the less they cared about the moral implications of destroying France. So - blood pouring from their gashed foreheads - the great leaders of the world organised for France to be removed.&#xa;&#xa;Obviously, there was global public anger at this move, with thousands of demonstrations organised all across the world.... Oh... who am I kidding? Of course there wasn't. Everyone merely turned a blind eye as France was lowered beneath the ocean where it flourished (admittedly free of life) as a modern-day Atlantis.&#xa;&#xa;Au Revoir, Monsieur Zidane.

<subject>Typical woman lol..?</subject><content>John had a terrible accident which mangled his private parts, requiring they be removed. His spirit was broken.&#xa;&#xa;His doctor told him: "John, all is not lost. I can make you better than before. It is possible for us to replace your lost member with a prostetic. However, the procedure is considered cosmetic and would not be paid by your insurance.&#xa;&#xa;The hope of regaining his manly prowess lifted John's heart to ask: "How much would it cost?"&#xa;&#xa;His doctor explained: "You can get the 4 inch model for £6,000.00 (John's frown quickly faded); or the 6 incher for £7,500.00 (John began to smile); or you may have the 9 inch version for £10,000.00." (John grinned as his eyes widened with anticipation)&#xa;&#xa;"But normally I insist that the decision be made only after you've consulted with your wife"&#xa;&#xa;John happily agreed, and set off for home.&#xa;&#xa;Upon his next return, the doctor asked for his decision. John hung his head sadly, replying: "She said for that kind of money, she'd rather a new kitchen."</content>

Or could it be something else?  Why is college football more exciting?</content>

He also got all sulky because he was not allowed to watch cartoons while everyone ate dinner.I got him a bunch of clothes for his birthday, and again in the summer because he needed them. He never says thank you. In fact after I got him the clothes for summer, he got VERY nasty with me a few days later.He is 12. The situation used to be worse, belive it or not.(see my other questions)He never appreciates anything, gets ruder to me when I am nicer to him, (lately I have just been avoiding him when he visits)My BF is now disclipiling him when he is nasty to me, but this happened only after I said "Make him behave or visit with him at a hotel on weekends"   He never says thank you for anything, I am tired of it.I am thinking of getting him a VERY small gift or nothing..I know it sounds horrible but try a weekend at my house.</content>

<subject>Did I make a mistake?</subject><content>Throughout my life, I've never had any close friends, just a ton of aquaintances. I spend my time usually alone, but i could care less. This year, I am a senior, and I guess the years of shortlived relationships just got to me. My current friends, who I've had for about all of high school, usually only invite me to things when I ask (this angered me so I stopped last May). &#xa;&#xa;However, around September, they began to make a habit of bullying me everyday because I stopped asking to hang out with them. Since then, I've completely ignored them; when they blatantly ask me questions in the hall, i just walk on by ignoring them. My idea behind this was that if they didn't care about me as a friend (considering I've never really had any), they would stop talking to me. However, they haven't, and I think i truly pissed them off. &#xa;&#xa;Did I make a mistake in ignoring my friends, dooming my Senior Year to once again be a lonely year? Or did I do the right thing in seeing if they were true friends?</content>

The owner has commissioned a market study that estimates an average customer’s annual demand curve for visiting the health club to be &#xa;&#xa;Q = 100 – ½ P, &#xa;&#xa;where Q is the number of visit per year by a consumer and P is the price per visit.&#xa;&#xa;The marginal cost to providing a visit is constant at $50. The owner is currently charging a $3,000 annual membership fee and $80 per-visit fee.

<subject>I feel real horrible.  Is there anyway that things can work out again?</subject><content>As I have posted before, my boyfriend's best friend has recently passed and he never told me.  I found out through someone else.  I would have thought he would have at least called to tell me.  I have called and texted him telling him I care about him and hope he is okay.  I haven't heard from him in a few days and I got angry and texted him saying  "Call me if you care.  I'm worried"  I felt horrible for doing that right afterwards.  I followed up with a text saying.  "Sorry for being selfish, I care about you and am worried that's all. Call me when you are ready. I'm sorry and hope youre ok xoxo".  I really care about him and he knows this.  I'm just so sad he hasn't called to tell me.  We got along well the last time we talked and he said he missed me and would see me soon.  I'm not going to text or call anymore.  Do you think I caused to much damage?  Is it time to move on anyway?</content>

I know he performed miracles, but I was thinking maybe there's some stuff on him that is being covered up or not exactly announced to the public. And before I submit this, I've said it before and I'll say it again, IF YOU'RE CHRISTIAN - UNLESS YOUR ACTUALLY GOING TO SUPPLY ME WITH VALUABLE INFORMATION - DON'T ANSWER THIS! I WANT REAL ANSWERS!

Im 4 1/2 weeks pregnant now, and the only thing I'm experiencing is sore breasts. My stomach has gotten tighter, I dont have cramps anymore but I do have on and off sickness. I know its too soon for my stomach to be tight like this I'm not bloated or gasous, i was wid my fist pregnancy but I know that im not now, but since this is my second pregnancy  I heard that things happen quicker than the first pregnancy, but I thought that wouldnt be the case for me since I wasnt pregnant that long. My question is am I being paranoid about the whole thing? Or is it really true?</content>

<subject>A British person's gripe?</subject><content>This is something that has got on my nerves for a good while concerning ambitious, young Aussie actors in soap operas like Neighbours and Home and Away.&#xa;&#xa;I get really sick of them using Britain as a stepping stone to the holy grail of success - Hollywood! We seem to get a lot of Aussie ex-soap stars coming to live over here for a year or so gushing their love of Britain in the pretense of  wanting to be a successful popstar or actor in Britain only to use us as some sort of booking agency to get themselves noticed accross the pond and get themselves some work in Hollywood, never to be seen again in Britain (and possibly back home. I don't know about that). If you want names that have done that in recent years try: Holly Valance, Stefan Dennis (failure), Danny Minogue, Isla Fisher and Nicole Kidman. All came here, gushing the vertues of living in Britain only to bugger off when 'real' success called in America where they wanted to be all along.&#xa;&#xa;Do you see that too in Australia?</content>

Isn't it unconstitutional? &#xa;Question Details: Hi, I'm confused, I'm reading about Vasilkovic V Commonwealth (2006) HCA 40 and I'm confused. This guy is a naturalised Australian, but a war criminal. If the extradition act says he can be extradited, how is that unconstitutional when the only reference to the consititution is S51 (xxix), which refers to the Commonwealth having external affairs powers. How can he claim he is being denied his liberty by 1) being arrested and 2) being extradited?</content>

<subject>police chief statements to the press?</subject><content>Ever notice when an officer, or officers, do things that are controversal - "here comes" the meeting with the press! and the chief  of police. &#xa;&#xa;Why is every time the chief has to stand with 2-4 other men, ALL having angry sneers while the chief makes a carefully worded statement? Worse! - when the press ask questions afterwards!! The chief always looks like he personally wants to arrest every reporter in the room!!&#xa;&#xa;What is with that?&#xa;&#xa;Our world leaders STAND ALONE at the podium, even when they, or their people, make a major mistake. And the do not look like they want to strangle someone while talking!!&#xa;&#xa;After Columbine, I watched an interview with the head of the SWAT team. He was ALONE, and seem to welcome questions. Even the embarrising ones. He was willing to admit that a situation such as Columbine, no one can be prepared for! Their people did a lot of things right, and a lot of things wrong. But at least they learned.&#xa;&#xa;Our Chief of Polices need to learn to be more humble...</content>

It's a hefty little camera with an annoying bright red light on the front.&#xa;&#xa;What is the deal with that spotlight? I could light up the bay and confuse Santa's joyride with it.&#xa;&#xa;It flashes during shutter delay modes, flashes in red-eye reduction mode, splashes the scene with red light during some focusing modes. What is Canon doing with it other than draining the battery?! It's very annoying when I'm just creeping around town trying to be unobtrusively and get a snapshot of criminals heading up the steps to the courthouse or, sneaking up on a kitten only to have it pounce on that red strobelight.&#xa;&#xa;I'm thinking about masking it with some black electrical tape.

So i wonder who else is offended by this? Minor girls have no clue about what is going on with their bodies in the first place and cant legally drink or smoke, but hell the lil brats do it anyway. Yet the girl can murder someone while she is still a child and there are no consequences!Parents should want to be aware of their child's actions especially in life threatening issues like this! Girls could die on the freakin operating table or die from excessive blood loss, because their bodies are underdeveloped and weak, but liberal california wanted to kill their own children!

I would go back and live with them if they would ease up on me and let me be an adult (I'm 26 years old, respsonsible, have a good job).  I know I hurt them and that hurts me but they've been so hard to work with in this engagment.  What is supposed to be the happiest time of my life has been miserable.</content>

<subject>What is the most respectful way to tell a woman that you want to see other people.?</subject><content>I have been divorced after 2 years and had stayed pretty much alone for the entire time.  I was really missing out on intimacy and sex.  So, I went with someone whom I wasn't as attracted too physically.  Her name is Kari.  It was nice but now, I sort of want to go to the next girl.  A few days after the sex, and sometimes during the time we were out doing things, I thought about my ex-wife.  So, I called the ex and talked with her a while and told her that I still had feelings that weren't completely dead and she pretty much reciprocated the same feelings.  I concluded that I am just gonna have to move on from the ex knowing that a little part of me will still love her.  I felt better.  Trouble is, I am pretty sure that Kari likes me and might be hurt.  I want to tell Kari the truth and I am asking all of you what is the best way that would be the most repectful way of doing that?  The really weird part is now, my ex-wife wants to come over and have sex too.  I am not willing for that</content>

<subject>Housebreaking an Apartment Pup?</subject><content>I have a 7 week old male husky pup who pees everywhere, never in the same place though.  I have laid down newspapers with pee soaked paper towels in the kitchen and have boarded it off for him, but he refuses to pee on the papers.   So I thought instead of placing him on the papers in the kitchen when he's about to have an accident, maybe it would be better to place him on the balcony.  I'm hoping he will understand that outside is the proper place to do his business.  Has anyone else tried this and have you had any success?  Also will this make the transition from balcony to actual outdoors any easier?&#xa;&#xa;We live on the third floor and are having a terrible time getting him downstairs in time, especially after he wakes up.</content>

<subject>Will a ford 4.0l v6 fit on the drivetrain/engine mounts of a 91 2.3l ranger?</subject><content>I have a 91 2.3l ranger with a blown engine.  I really don't want to rebuild the engine myself because of all the time involved, and its a poor investment to have a shop do it because they would charge more the the truck is worth. Whats more, I need more power then the 4 cyl provides, because I use it around the farm as well as a daily driver.  when it was running it acted like a dying duck when pulling an empty one horse trailer.  I don't really want to scrap it because its in awesome condition (clean title, two owners, no wrecks, no dents, interior is awesome), it just doesn't run.  &#xa;&#xa;If.. it didn't involve too much cutting and welding I would really like to put a ford 302 in it... :-D  &#xa;&#xa;suggestions?</content>

It wasn't just Tom and Gail and the guest judge of the week, was it?  &#xa;&#xa;This season they have that new chick Padma Lakshmi.  Looks like they're trying to add a little sex appeal to the show (what was up with her short Daisy Dukes when they did that ice cream challenge??)&#xa;&#xa;Anyway - I can't seem to find any info on the judges panel for season one - can anyone refresh my memory?&#xa;&#xa;Thanks!</content>

<subject>need creative responses from girls?</subject><content>I need to ask you something... I know it sounds twisted, but I really am trying to get the best, most original answer - please reply: &#xa;&#xa;I am writing a science fiction love story. It's kind of twisted, but I need some help with wording. Okay, I'll tell you the part real brief. &#xa;&#xa;This girl had a boyfriend who was a real creep. He cheated on her, treated her like crap - etc. He was also a womanizer who mistreated her girlfriends. &#xa;&#xa;One day, a witch shrinks him to about 1/4 inch tall and she decides to toss him into the leg of her stocking overnight. &#xa;&#xa;The next day, she's late for college, and she dresses very quickly - forgetting that he's there. lol &#xa;&#xa;Well, she remembers just as it's too late. She has no time to unchange and there he is trapped against her thigh with the tight nylon material. He screams, but no one can hear him. &#xa;&#xa;(okay just for a moment, pretend you are the girl and I'll be the guy. I just can't get the words and I need some help. You will basically say that you're keeping me in there for the day (and probably every day)). &#xa;&#xa;When you answer, try to make it as mean and creative as possible. &#xa;&#xa;"Help me!!! YOU can't just leave me in here!!! LET ME OUT OF HERE!!!! NOW!!!" &#xa;&#xa;your reply? &#xa;&#xa;ty!</content>

I tried to apply for retail, bank, clerical jobs at the college and posted ads.&#xa;&#xa;I had already told several people I know, and friends, but I think I have very few contacts who can help me find a right job. &#xa;&#xa;Employment/recruiting agencies can't seem to help me. Sometimes I'd get a call from few agencies only to verify basic information about me but rarely or never received a call for a job.&#xa;&#xa;It seems hard to concentrate on school work, and not to worry much about finding and getting a job at the same time.</content>

He has been hurt by neighbors before; they poured some kind of acid on him around a year ago.  It is horrible for him to stay inside, and my kids cant resist his whining at the door.  He has a wound on his face now that just makes me ill.  His cheek area is damaged.  It is a rather gruesome wound.  Have meds from the vet, it will heal and mend, but I want to convert him from indoor/outdoor to strictly indoor.  I am tired of him getting hurt.  He has lost a step and is getting the worst of the battles these days.  I want to neuter him and was wondering if it might keep him home.  Id like to see him grow old with us.  He is awesome with the kids, loving and smart, but this territorialness and the peeps that hurt him before scare me. I need suggestions for the convesion process.  Please help, I am afraid  he will get killed one day.  I couldnt bear that.</content>

He and I have become quite friendly with one another, often emailing each other asking how our weekends have been, sharing a funny video, etc. Although the emails are usually initiated by me, he seems to enjoy getting them. Is it against any policy to date your professor? The class is almost over, and I do not plan on taking anymore classes taught by this professor. I am also wondering how to express my feelings for him. I know he feels an attraction towards me. I do not know what to do... Also&#xa;He is not married. I know that for a fact. And he is currently single. I know he is at a different stage in his life right now, but I'm willing to get to know him better, and become friends with him in the least. He does not talk to any other student that I am aware of...</content>

Well lately, I've been breaking out a bit (about 4 pimples)...and then I started thinking about when I'm 52, if I don't care for my skin now, then I'm going to look really old by then. I don't even use sunscreen. (I have a olive complexion, so not fair skinned whatsoever). &#xa;&#xa;What would be a good sunscreen to put on my face and stuff? Would it be good to get one that is SPF and mosturizor combo? What creams and stuff would be good too? &#xa;&#xa;What should I be using to make my skin even, and keep it hydrated and smooth and stuff? &#xa;&#xa;I wish I had an older sister for this very reason =(. My mom is 53 but looks more like 60-something (but she's a smoker and I'm not, I hardly even touch alcohol either). I really don't want that.&#xa;&#xa;Thank you.</content>

<subject>Mother in-law visits whenever she wants?</subject><content>Wondering if its bad of me or crazy to expect that when my mother-in-law visits, its a defined timeframe that we have talked about and agreed upon, or I should allow for an open door policy.  She lives really far away, and has for a long time been allowed to come and go as she pleases, everyone drops everything and moves aside to accomodate.  I'm the newbe about to be married and up to this point I've stepped aside, recently I've felt that at least a  phone call and a "is this time good for you" would be nice.  I"ve mentioned this to my significant other and am feeling low because I don't want to put him in the position of having to put new restraints on his relationship, at the same time I don't want to walk around resentful because no one asked me if its ok.  I don't want to create an enemy by getting in the way, and I'm hoping I'm not appearing selfish to my significant other.  Any advice?</content>

<subject>Long term relationship:  She stays out late.  I do not and getting frustrated.  How can we get through this?</subject><content>She works a retail job with an odd schedule. I work as computer programmer with a set schedule and weekends off. I goto bed at Midnight and wake up at 8-8:30am every day and I am also a light sleeper.&#xa;&#xa;Lately, she has been going out with her friends at night then coming home around 2-3am, maybe usually once a week, sometimes twice. She always invites me out but I don't like staying out late in the middle of the week because of work. Usually she hasn't been going out this often. I am starting to get frustrated by being woken up when I hear the key hit the door and she drags herself to the bed then passes out, leaving me wide awake for another hour. The following work day, I'm tired and it is difficult to concentrate on my work.&#xa;&#xa;We've lived together for a few years now and I feel like we communicate very well. With this topic however, she tells me that she understands how I feel but will not compromise because she likes going out with her friends and have fun.</content>

<subject>why did he do this?</subject><content>there is this guy that comforted me one night about 8 months ago,he is freinds with my ex who i caught cheating on me,i was bitter about the cheating and this guy listened and understood and ended up driving me home that night and i invited him to stay,i asked him to sleep in the bed with me,he did,i asked him to put his arm around me he did till i slept and was such a gentlaman.I saw him a couple months after and he came to me and said"your killing me"i never saw him again until 6 months after that, at a party and he he saw me when he walked in, and looked away real quick.He, a little later ran into me crossing paths and said"hey whats up",we made small talk here and there throughout the night.I am just wondering why he did not smile or say hi when he looked right at me,was he trying to avoid me?It was a party,so there was no way of avoiding the whole night.The problem is i still think about that night he comforted me,and its been 8 months since.</content>

<subject>is God's technology more advanced than ours?</subject><content>How come he wrote on stone tablets instead of sending his message on a CD.  CDs or DVDs would have been a lot easier to carry than an ark full of scrolls.  &#xa;&#xa;He could have just appeared to Saul in the sky or on a Panasonic flat screen TV in the sky in all of his HD glory and that would have been a lot more effective than blinding him.  &#xa;&#xa;Hell, God in Technicolor would have convinced me, even without surround sound. &#xa;&#xa;Or do you think God has some special stuff more advanced than the PS3 and he's just waiting for us to develop a machine that would be compatable?</content>

<subject>Looking for good ghost/haunting books?</subject><content>I have just begun to get interested in the horror fiction genre. I am looking for some good books in that area but not a lot of blood and gore or grose stuff. I just like a good story line/plot and maybe supernatural or metaphysical content. Erotica is ok, just not into the grose stuff. Amazon has recommended Tamara Thorne's "Haunted" and Scott Nicholson. Susan Hill's The woman in Black. Hell House and The Haunting of Hill House. I'm wondering what you think of these books as well as any others you can recommend. Thank you for your time, I appreciate all answers.</content>

<subject>My iTunes Podcasts sporadically appear greyed-out and won't play. How do I fix it?</subject><content>I have a Windows XP computer. For about 9 months, I've been successfully using iTunes and addicted to Podcasts. Recently single episodes from a variety of different sources have occasionally appeared greyed out (while other fresh downloads work normally). However, the blue dot that indicates an unplayed program is displayed, and when I click on "update," nothing happens.&#xa;&#xa;If I wipe out the episode, go to the iTunes store, and click on the "get episode" button, it downloads, but this eliminates all the benefits of subscribing. I have the settings set for "download all unplayed episodes."&#xa;&#xa;I tried downloading the most recent iTunes update, but this had no impact on the problem. Any clue about what is happening and how I can fix it?</content>

<subject>Girls: do you ever feel like just being single even if there's a guy you love?</subject><content>Say you dated a guy for about a year and things were great and you were about to move in with him, and you guys talked about marriage and having kids, etc. Like two-three months before you guys were suppose to get an apartment you started feeling like this is the guy you'll be with forever and while that is what you want you start to realize you won't ever be single again....that you've jumped from one relationship to another all your life, you just wanted to be single for now...being 21. Does that make sense? Then a few weks before apt. time you guys start arguing and decide to take a break.&#xa;I guess what I'm asking is, is it selfish to tell a guy you just wanna be single right now, to have fun with friends, but you know your future is with this guy? Do you think the guy would understand? Wait for you? Like if you said "when I'm ready for a committed relationship, I know you're the one I want"...Do you ever just feel like you need to enjoy being single before you decide to be with som</content>

<subject>Do you think the demarcates are going to really make things better here for Americans?</subject><content>I live in Milwaukee, our city has a demacratic Mayor, a commun council domanated buy demacrates, our county supervisors are predomanently demacrates, our school board is all demacrates, we have a demacrate as a district attorny, Milwaukee is a demacraticly run city and it has been for decades. Yet for a city it's size, we are tenth in the nation as a violent city, we have one of the highest teenage pregnacy rates in the nation, a few months ago we were voted the angryest city in the nation, we have one of the highest drop out rates of high school students in the nation, we were told today that over half of the ninth graders in the Milwaukee school systum are truent, we have a understaffed Police department, (which has a demacratic Police Cheif), It just goes on and on. So why do you all out there who helped put them back in charge of this country think things are going to get better, they aren't here. Maybe when we get hit again it'll be a sobering wake up call to you all.</content>

<subject>What do you people do to enjoy yourself when going clubbing? I really don't get it.?</subject><content>How do you people enjoy yourself when going clubbing? I really don't get it. Clubbing is something I don't understand. But I'm too curious to just let go and forget about it.&#xa;I can see there's obviously a lot of fun to be had - but I find myself unable to get excited at all.&#xa;Could it just be self-awareness or anxiety or what? Yes I'm a bit shy but not that much. There must be more to it.&#xa;Many people tell me 'if it's not your thing, then don't try too hard to do it.' But I'm really jealous of people who can go and have a good time - because in the end it MUST be fun! So how come I don't experience any fun?&#xa;So how do you go about it? I know for most of you it all comes quite naturally, but if you had to have a closer look, what's the way you let go and have a good time?&#xa;(apart from the obvious tips about alcohol and drugs of course)&#xa;Thanks, Vickie</content>

<subject>Can you find the source for this quote from the Christians and offered as a fact by the biblebelievers site?</subject><content>The president of the New York Scientific Society once gave eight reasons why he believed there was a God. The first was this: Take 10 identical coins and mark them 1 to 10. Place them in your pocket. Now take one out. There is 1 chance in 10 that you will get number one. Now replace it, and the overall chance that number two follows number one is not 1 in 10, but 1 in 100. With each new coin taken out, the risk will be multiplied by 10, so that the chance of ten following nine, is 1 in 10 000 000 000 or 10 billion. It seemed so unbelievable to me that I immediately took pencil and paper and very quickly discovered he was right. Try it yourself</content>

<subject>Benny Hinn-a healer or a fraud???? Lets be honest, he looks like a fraud to me, your opinion?</subject><content>There aren't any healers today as Jesus Healed. But BH wants you to think that he is. When Jesus showed up, ALL deseases and handicaps were healed. I saw a story on PBS a few years ago where they had evidence that he is a fraud because the one he claimed to heal, died 6 months later of the same cancer that BH said he healed. I think it was a child, as I recall.</content>

<subject>41 weeks, 3 cm for the last 3 weeks, contracting every 10 minutes...HELP!!!?</subject><content>I'm 41 weeks, 3 cm, and contracting.  Labor and Delivery sent me home last Wednsday while I was having contractions every 2-3 minutes.  I was so miserable.  I eventually fell asleep, because I was exhausted, but I just think that it was wrong for them to send me home in that condition.  I am absolutely miserable, and can barely get up from my bed without literally groaning so loud that my neighbors can hear.  When I walk I look like I will collapse in any of my next steps.  Is it possible to go into labor and just not dilate?  I lost my mucus plug about a week ago, but still no water-breaking action.  I really want to avoid a C-section, but I'm afraid that because of my small frame, and such a large baby, I won't be able to avoid it.  Is there anything I can do?  Can someone please give me some advise?  I'm a first timer, and really don't even know what I should do.  Also, being in the military doesn't help much, because the facilities have a pretty heartless staff.</content>

<subject>I need advice on which kind of hair products and methods to use on curly hair.?</subject><content>Ok, so my mom is white and my dad is black. So my hair is a frizzy dark with different types of curls. My hair is a little more than shoulder length. Close to my scalp is wavy, next is kinda straight(doesn't curl), then the ends are the most curly part of my hair.&#xa;I have been using John Frieda Curly shampoo and conditioner. But I would really like to find a product or method to make my hair into something more managable and curly all over. At least the same hair type throughout my head, not three. &#xa;&#xa;*I need to know the best kind of product to shampoo and conditon my hair. &#xa;*What kind of product to use after the shower to style and hopefully curl it. &#xa;*Can my hair be curly all over? &#xa;*Should I buy a diffuser? &#xa;*Do those work?&#xa;I'm a low maintenance girl, I don't spend alot of time in the morning fighting with my hair to be nice and curly. But if I can have the kind of curls I want, I would be more than willing to try new methods.</content>

<subject>Kindly Help.......?</subject><content>I am totally confused....&#xa;I do not have anything going for me.....&#xa;   (1.) I am a middle class guy aged 29(twenty nine). Have around Rs.3 million lying with me since 2 years but can't figure out what business to start. I've been investing in shares all these years but I dream of making it real big one day, unfortunately I don't have the kind of finances (around 1 crore) required for the same. I also do not have much of work experience(just 1 yr in sales and BPO). In addition to that I am just a Second Class commerce graduate and hence expecting a good job is sheer stupidity. BUT I AM QUITE INTELLIGENT. &#xa;&#xa;   (2.) My GF thinks I am an ultra rich guy &amp; am just 24 yrs of age (I admit I lied 2 her coz I thought an age difference of 9 wud b a big turn-off. But I really luv her). &#xa;&#xa;    (3.)I've been in dis relationship for 7 mths now. Initially my GF did say she loved me but now she says she loves me in a different way. She says she is not sure whether I am the 1 for her.&#xa;&#xa;Kindly Help</content>

<subject>If my lesbian girlfriend is uncomfortable with public kissing, does that mean that our relationship won't work</subject><content>I am a 21 year old female student in LA.  I met another woman my age and we're in love.  There's one huge issue that is troubling me:  my girlfriend doesn't want to be my "girlfriend" in public.  She's an aspiring actress and thinks being publicly perceived as a lesbian would harm her career.  My girlfriend has said that it is OK for us to tell family members about our relationship (we have, and they all approve), but that in public, we need to be "just friends"--and that from time to time she will have to appear to have a "boyfriend" in order to squelch rumors she is a lesbian. &#xa;&#xa;I am torn.  I love my girlfriend and want to be with her.  I also want to be honest about who we are.  I don't want to put unreasonable demands on her, but as time goes on and our relationship deepens, I am afraid that this will be a secret impossible to keep--and both of us are going to be terribly hurt.  My father agrees that being "publicly lesbian" CAN harm her acting career--and I don't want that at all!</content>

<subject>How can I tell if my Gooseneck Sofa is an Antique or Reproduction?</subject><content>I have a sofa that was given to me.  The arms of the are sofa are "rolled" and upholstery covered but there is a carved wooden "frame".  On the carved part of the arms, instead of a goose design, end in a  wooden scroll/ball that curves from the sofa arm.  The gooseneck is actually carved into the woodwork at the center of the sofa back.  The feet of the sofa are also wood &amp; have the same scroll/ball design.  The wood is dark and I don't believe the upholstery is original.  Can anyone help? or at least give me some idea of where to look?</content>

<subject>Are Parachial schools better than public schools?</subject><content>Parachial (Catholic) schools have a reputation for being better than public schools. They teach mostly the same curricula - BUT is the main difference that they don't tolerate unruly children in the class room?  Public school teachers have to put up with more disruptions, bad behavior, etc. - and this leads to ALL the students (even the good ones) getting less time learning. Is this accurate and worth paying the extra money?</content>

<subject>Sick of selfish people driving SUVs?</subject><content>These awful cars need to be taken off the road. Children MIGHT be safer in them, but at the cost of any other poor child who happens to get in the way of one. Not only are they heavy and unsafe to pedestrians, but they also have massive blind spots.&#xa;Their sales are high because they pander to people's paranoia about safety as well as a lot of driver's personal insecurity and lack of self esteem. In the old days these latter drove fast sports cars, but now our roads are so blocked that they find no pleasure in this, so they go for size and muscle instead. &#xa;Then of course there are the environmental costs.&#xa;I live down a long farm track in the country, but I also know that anyone competant to drive can get a modern front wheel drive car through virtually anything, including quite deep snow.</content>

<subject>Christian Union at Exeter?</subject><content>What does everyone think of the recent controversy over the CU who was told it would be cut off, supposedly for being 'discriminatory' and 'exclusive'? All because their form said that members 'had accepted Jesus Christ as their Saviour and Lord.&#xa;  I am in Newcastle University CU and I thought the whole idea of a Christian Union was to promote Christ and bring together fellow student Christians. If you go to CU you must at least accept the beliefs of the group. My own Christian Union group asks exactly the same thing as this CU group- that you accept Jesus as Saviour- with few problems at all. &#xa;  I think this is just another example of how religious belief is so belittled and shamefully mocked in this country. I hope this CU wins their case.</content>

Why do people not understand that we should become even more Imperialistic and impose our views on the lesser barbaric nations of the world. It is either us or them and in my opinion the Arabs are way to barbaric and primitive and the nations in the middle east will never achieve what our great American Republic has!  Neither will The EU amount to anything but the huge super failure it is!  Nor will India become a world power or China.</content>

<subject>Was I out of line with a rude subway rider?</subject><content>I worked 10 hours or so one day last week. It was the grand opening of a new store, so my coworkers and I had celebrated by drinking champagne afterwards. Needless to say, I was exhausted by the time I got on the train to go home. I sat in the double seats that faced sideways and propped my foot up on the seats in front of me.  A few stops later, a man got on the train and sat in the seats in front of me and plopped his briefcase down as if my foot was't there. (the briefcase was leaning on my foot.)&#xa;&#xa;This was not the last seat. There were plenty of empty seats available, and I mean that one end of the train was completely empty. I aggressivly kicked his briefcase to move it off my foot. I continued writing in my journal, and out of the corner of my eye, I could see him glaring at me. He got up and moved a couple of stops later. Was I wrong for doing this?</content>

<subject>I'm so sad!!!?</subject><content>Last year i had a friend. A best friend, i could tell him anything. I had a slight crush on him too. He was in a lot of my classes and we were really close. This year i haven't said one word to him and i thought he had completly forgotten about me. But as close as we were i started to think and you just can't forget that. I'm too shy to talk to him, but i wish that he would have talked to me. Why are we completly out of each others lives this year, i hate it and i can't show it. Hes mom just recently got cancer too. So this morning he was on my bus because they moved to a hotel. He passed me and didn't say a word, but he talked to my other friends. Did I do something. I beleive that if you can't get someone out of your head, then maybe there supposed to be there. But why is he in my head. I don't like him anymore. Well i donn't have a crush on him anymore. But i really wish we could have stayed friends. This whole thing is so confusing and i really need someones help or oppinion. HELP!</content>

<subject>An Army of One???</subject><content>I had to sit down recently and think about the new slogan for today's Army. Not counting the war we are currently fighting, I don't think that the change in the slogan makes the US Army seem any better. Let alone, with the way soldiers are entering nowadays. Basic Training and AIT soldiers are taking over DS' (which I think is total BS). Being more lenient on a soldier and pushing them through without passing the Army's PT standards. I'd have to say that the new slogan is just mocking what today's modern Army is becoming. I don't mean to offend anybody who currently is still serving because I myself am still serving. I would like to know what is on other peoples minds pertaining to the new slogan and their opinions on IET soldiers going through training.</content>

<subject>How do I handle a 1 year old's bleeding pierced ears?</subject><content>We got out 1 year old daughter's ears pierced about 2 months ago.  We cleaned them dilligently multiple times every day.  We decided to take out the original studs for the first time to switch to another pair.  When we took them out, the holes bled a little.  We cleaned her ears and tried to put in the new pair, but her ears started bleeding more.  This all happened last night and we ended up leaving the earings out overnight.  My question is, should we try and put the earings back in tonight, or should we let the ears heal more.  Our concern about leaving them out is that we don't want the holes to close up and have her go through this all over again.  Please provide constructive answers and not criticism about infant ear piercing.  Thank you.</content>

While she was there she got a bug and as I visited I caught the bug,which was then passed down to my son. She ended up back in the hospital as she has a copd and had a harder time fighting it then we did. IT damn near killed her.  It took me over two months and 4 different kinds of antibiotics and steroid inhalers to get rid of it. I say it as no one had a name for what we had. My son 14 I took him to a different doctor and they put him on inhalers and a very strong antiobiotic,steroid shots and breathing treatments. This doctor told me that they have no idea what this was but it was strong and very hard to get rid of thats why she was doing such aggressive treatments with him. I feel it should be a law that they have to let the public know what there getting into when entering a Danger Zone (hospital).</content>

When we're apart he never calls and emails only if I email him, or if not than like a day or two before we have plans to see each other again.  He has not had much experience with women or r/ships, I saw him complain on an old blog that women are never interested in him.  &#xa;&#xa;I'm so crazy about him I miss him so much and this is just not enough contact for me but yet I don't want to smother him.  Oh, and when we're together he acts like he's in love with me.  What is going on with him?  Either he is not that into me, or he is playing it cool, or he just doesn't know how to be in a relationship with a woman.  Any ideas?  Thanks!!!</content>

<subject>Where should i live in GLASGOW?</subject><content>I currently live in London with my partner and 2 year old daughter but we want to move back to Glasgow.  I've been away for almost 20 years so don't have a clue where we should buy a house.  We currently live in Crouch End which has a 'villagey' type feel with its own hight street with nice cafes, restaurants and individual shops.  I'd like to find a similar area in Glasgow as close to the west end as possible.  Obviously a nursery and good primary school are really important.  Don't think we could afford a house in the west end proper - looking for 4/5 bedrooms up to a max of 700k.  Any advice much appreciated.</content>

<subject>What Should I Say?</subject><content>this guy was my friend for about 3 months and we literally hang out together  like...every second of our lives and I really know him, and he really knows me, and one day, he asked his x-girlfriend if I want to go out with him. she asked me and is probably telling everyone about it. plus, I reeeaaalllyyy like this OTHER guy and he probably like me too, but haven't said anything. So, my friend wants to ask me out and this is my first date. I don't know what to say. I don't want to hurt his feelings by saying no, and this is probably the only chance I'll get asked out. I do like him alot, and I do like to go out with him, but I don't like him as much as the other guy and I don't want to ruin any chances with him. &#xa;and...what do you do when you go out? i  need answers quick plz!!!</content>

<subject>Where is cheaper to buy a car? San Diego or Dallas?</subject><content>I have a 6V Liberty but I will be moving from San Diego to Dallas in June. I want to change it for a 4V Compass (jeep).

With the inconvenience of spending a lot in gas and mileage too.</content>

<subject>Concerning my best friend's bf?</subject><content>It all started when I was talking with my best friend's boyfriend online and we were talking about how last year he sat down on a piece of gum and it smeared all over his pants. I told him that I saw the gum like 10 min. before he sat on it but I had forgotten to tell him it was there. Then he got really mad at me and called me a b*tch. And he said i deserved to be called a b*tch. I didn't yell at him for it then, we just kept on with the conversation. But I decided that he shouldn't be allowed to do that, so I asked him why he did it, maybe yelled just a little bit, the next day and he said he was sorry. I don't know if I should tell my friend about it because this is the first one that she has liked in a looooong time who hasn't been a complete slug. She's so happy! I don't want to ruin it for her but I don't know if she would want me to not tell her about it. What if she finds out some other way and gets mad at me? Should I tell her or what? I'm so confused!</content>
<subject>does jw suppose to disown their kids?</subject>
<subject>Can A Rottweiler and a Great Dane co-exist?</subject><content>I have a 115 lb 2 yr old Rott and my boss has a 1 yr old Great Dane. Sadly though, my boss is moving out of town and he can't take his dog with him. He has bought his dog up to our job on several occasions and the dog is very sweet and loving. He recently asked me if i want the dog. I have a large, fenced in yard so space isn't a problem, but i a little concerned about how my dog would get along with the Dane. They are both male dogs and my dog is a little territorial. My boss said he would rather see me take the dog than give him to a shelter or sell him to someone that he doesn't know. I really love this dog and would like to have him, so my boss is going to bring the Dane over to my house this week end just to see if they get along. Is this a good idea or am i asking for trouble? My boss said all dogs are a little territorial but once they meet and get used to being around each other everything will be fine. Any experts out there that can help me with this?</content>

<subject>Ladies, what standards does a guy have to meet to get a date from you?</subject><content>Girls…If a guy asks you out on a date, what are the biggest things that’ll determine whether or not you’ll take him up on his offer? I’ve heard that a decent amount of “hot” woman out there are probably more willing to give it a try than most guys are willing to think. If he seems half-way normal, and is not full of acne or morbidly obese…would you give it a try? Or do you need to feel some sort of intense love connection before you give it a go? I sometimes get the feeling that 80% of everyone who is single is just walking around thinking inside their heads “Damn, I wish I had a date for tonight,” but everyone is just too afraid to ask anyone else…</content>

<subject>Could my daughter be in danger?</subject><content>My daughter is a beautiful 15 year old.  Like most teenage girls, she looks older than she is. This weekend she had her  friend sleep over.  Her friend just turned 14 and is beautiful and looks and acts older.  The friend has been over many times, and has been around my boyfriend (39 years old) a lot.  Saturday night, my daughters friend told me that she feels uncomfortable with the way my live in boyfriend of almost 2 years has been looking at her.  I started to pay attention, and while he does seem to be staring at her, I dont necessarily see him like totally checking her out, if you know what I mean.  She also told my daughter that he stares at her (my daughter) when she isnt looking.  Like he is checking her out.  About a year ago my daughter on one occasion told me that she doesnt like to look him in the eye because she is afraid she may not like the look in his eye. I have seen him check out young girls in the stores before.  He has a 9 year old daughter and 16 year old son.</content>

<subject>If the Black Stone of the Ka’aba fell at the feet of Adam, what happened to it in the worldwide flood?</subject><content>It is claimed by Muslims that the (originally pagan) Black Stone of the Ka’aba, in Mecca, fell from the moon and landed at the feet of Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden. There is no historical or Biblical evidence for this belief.  Obviously, unless it was taken aboard the Ark by Noah it would have been lost during the worldwide flood and so after the flood it could not have been identified from any other, ordinary piece of  black rock. As there is no evidence for a black stone being taken on board the Ark, perhaps someone can explain,- - - &#xa;1. How anyone could possibly know that it fell at the feet of Adam and Eve? &#xa;2. What happened to it during the flood? &#xa;Please give evidence.</content>

<subject>United States Collapse?!?</subject><content>I was discussing some differences between Republican conservatism and Democratic liberalism in the US with an Evangelical pastor yesterday (Nov. 12), and I was surprised to hear him express the serious consideration of abandoning the United States as the world Evangelical HQ. &#xa;The reason, he siad, was the Democratic party's gaining of power over the country's legislative system, which meant the upper hand for all those who call for the separation of religion from state, and the abolishing of all visible religious forms from public places and schools and the "under God" term from the pledge of allegiance and so and so. He finally put it, "because there's no telling just when the US would come to a sudden breakdown, which is very likely, given all the moral regression plaguing the nation". &#xa;So, where do we stand on this one; Republican conservatism, or Democratic liberalism; who's out to save America?</content>

<subject>Funny Joke?</subject><content>A state trooper sees a car puttering along at &#xa;22 mph and thinks, This driver is just as dangerous as a speeder! So he pulls the car over. There are four elderly ladies in the car, wide-eyed and white as ghosts. The driver says, &#xa;&#xa;"Officer, what seems to be the problem?"&#xa; "Ma'am," the officer replies, "you should know that driving under the speed limit can be a danger to other drivers."&#xa;"I was doing the speed limit exactly - 22 miles an hour!" the old lady says. The trooper, trying not to laugh, explains to her that 22 is the route number not the speed limit. The woman grins sheepishly and thanks the officer for pointing out her error.&#xa; "But before I let you go, ma'am, are the other ladies okay? They seem shaken and haven't uttered a peep this whole time." &#xa;"Oh, they'll be fine in a minute." The driver says, "we just got &#xa;off Route 119."</content>
<subject>How long does it take for a broken heart to mend?</subject><content>About a year ago the love of my life ended our three year relationship after a weekend of arguing. Although I know that things were getting bad between us, I always thought we could work through anything. I admit that I made a lot of mistakes and put her through a lot but I never thought that she would walk away. Now she is in love with another man and although I have been with a few women since her, none of them can manage to erase her memory or the constant pain that I feel from her absence in my life. To this day, over a year later, I literally think of her from the moment I wake until I fall asleep only to endure another night of dreaming of her. Is my heart eternally broken? If there is such a thing as a soul mate, Did I find mine and let her slip through my fingers? and if so, how does one recover from such a devastating event? I am convinced that I will never truly love again, but, if you have another theory please let me know.</content>

<subject>Football games...anyone agree?</subject><content>Well I have season tickets to my team's games and I find it so annoying when there are loud abnoxious fans behind or around me that are yelling things that don't make any sense or are talking (very loudly) about things that aren't true.  Like they just have their facts all wrong.  My urge to turn around and correct their stupidness is hard to control when that happens.  And maybe it's just me, but it seems to happen almost every game.  It would be one thing if they were just talking amongst themselves about things but to be yelling out and screaming things that are just wrong.....annoys the crap outta me!!  Anyone else feel the same way?</content>

<subject>My boyfriend and I are fighting...?</subject><content>Last weekend on Saturday, my boyfriend and I got into a big argument over the phone. I told him to leave the house and leave the keys, in which he did.&#xa;&#xa;And the next morning I felt terrible so I phoned him to apologize for kicking him out, he ended calling me a **** and other terrible names so I hung up on him. Then I tried to call him that night, because I thought he was out drinking, and honestly I missed him. But apparently he was at his mother's not accepting my calls. I felt really upset. I decided to just forget it and wait for him to call me back and apologize for ignoring me but so far nothing except for when he called to say he's going to pick up his **** a few days ago.&#xa;&#xa;So the question is... is it over and I should just forget it? or should I call him? or continue waiting for him to call? should I be upset for him calling me down or forget it?</content>

<subject>What kind of intelligence could exist fully formed from nothing?</subject><content>Here in the real world we can see that intelligence is a product of growth and learning and development.  It's a measure of how well we apply what we have learned from the past to situations we are dealing with in the present.  Even if you don't accept that human intelligence is the result of 4 billion years or so of evolution, it's still clearly the case that a new born baby is pretty clueless, and only becomes intelligent over the years by learning from experience.&#xa;&#xa;Theists assert that an intelligent god exists, fully formed, from nothing, with no history, no growth, no learning from experience, no development of any sort.  I would like to hear someone explain the nature of that intelligence such that it can exist without experience and without even the passage of time.  What does intelligence mean, if not the ability to apply what we've learned from experience, and thus requiring development and the passing of time?&#xa;&#xa;All intelligent answers welcome!  ;-)</content>

<subject>Masters in Finance vs. Masters in Economics?</subject><content>Being a senior in college is reminiscent of those days as a senior in High School. Few answers, more questions, and that is where I turn to you folks.&#xa;&#xa;Ideally, I want to get into a masters in Finance program. However, most of the top programs today require at least two years job experience. I do not want to turn to necessarily go this route, since people I have talked to have said that it is definitely harder going back to school after starting any job. Also, I am personally in favor of getting a masters degree at the earliest, rather than later.  So, I am also considering a masters in economics. What are the tradeoffs in going this route versus the other? &#xa;&#xa;I would love to hear your suggestions and opinions. Thank you for your advice and happy holidays!</content>

<subject>Heart Question Noise With Heartbeat (Doctors and Nurses Only Please)?</subject><content>i have been able to hear my heartbeat in my ears for over four months.I can hear it so well that its like I have a stethocope on.It was dignosed ast Patulous Eustecian tube.Before I went to the doctor with this I could hear what sounded to me like on around the fifth hearbeat my heart sounds as if its catching up,or maybe its just a consistant extra sound.While I was at the doctors officce she told me that i had a murmur .I ask if I needed test and she said no.She sent me to an ent that told me about the PET and said I didn't need extra test either.The sound that im hearing im wondering if that is what she called a mumur or is this something else that two doctors didn't notice? I am concerned about it and I also have PTSD .I also was curious if this could contribute to making that sound .Could they have missed the sound or is that maybe what they considered a murmur?

<subject>Can anyone help explain a knocking/banging noise coming from my saab 9-3 convertible?</subject><content>There is a knocking/banging/cluncking sound coming from the middle-back of my Saab 9-3 convertible.  It happens when you apply the brakes at low speed and then accelerate away (such as coming up to a speed bump, in traffic, coming up to a roundabout etc) or when you pump the brakes at low speed. It doesn't occur at higher speeds.  It sounds likes something rolling/ knocking into something else and falling back again.  I have recently had the rear brakes and discs changed, the suspension re-torqued and the exhaust rubbers changed.  It's still there!  You can hear it when you are outside the car also.  There is no drop in the performance of the car at all. I am convinced that it is coming from inside the body of the car, underneath the rear seat. I can assure you all that it has nothing to do with someone such as my mother in law being trapped in my boot!! Would appreciate any ideas, as this is getting annoying.</content>

<subject>Voting today and the separation of church and state?</subject><content>I am an Atheist.  I will be voting later today.  My voting place is in a local church.  I can get by that, but......in order to get to the polls there is an open bible you have to walk past.  The only way in and out.  Is this really OK?  I have inquired in the past and was told this was the only place to vote and no one would address the issue.  Should the book be moved or covered?  I do not want to vote absentee, as I do not think they are really counted.  No smart a** answers please.  Thank you.</content>

I'm not going to even start trying to have a child for over a year--so I can lose some weight...but even dieting is waaaaayyy hard for me...but I'm willing to do whatever it takes to have a healthy child and pregnancy.  My husband says he will help me thru all of it.  How much should I lose?  at least 100 pounds is my guess...Is that too much, too little?  Is there an easy way to lose the weight?  Is there any vitamins/suppliments I can take?  How much should I lose and How many months will it take for me to get to a target weight?  I live too far from any gyms...but I am willing to rent excercise videos and eat right....Whaddya'll think?</content>

<subject>Ladies- Do you really want to have a cure for this?</subject><content>A man and a woman are sitting beside each other in the first class section of the plane.&#xa;&#xa;The woman sneezes, takes a tissue, gently wipes her nose and shudders quite violently in her seat.&#xa;&#xa;The man isn’t sure why she is shuddering and goes back to reading.&#xa;&#xa;A few minutes pass. The woman sneezes again. She takes a tissue, gently wipes her nose and shudders quite violently in her seat.&#xa;&#xa;The man is becoming more and more curious about the shuddering.&#xa;&#xa;A few more minutes pass. The woman sneezes yet again. She takes a tissue, gently wipes her nose and shudders violently again.&#xa;&#xa;The man has finally had all he can handle. He turns to the woman and says, “three times you’ve sneezed and three times you’ve taken a tissue and wiped your nose then shuddered violently!&#xa;&#xa;Are you sending me signals, or are you going crazy?”&#xa;&#xa;The woman replies, “I’m sorry if I disturbed you. I have a rare condition and when I sneeze I have an orgasm.”&#xa;&#xa;The man, now feeling a little embarrassed but even more curious says, “I’ve never heard of that before. What are you taking for it?”&#xa;&#xa;The woman looks at him and says, “Pepper.”</content>

I got bashed for being the cheater! I even said in the question that I was asking that it was not me that did the cheating. So why is it that some people don't read the whole thing before they answer a question? All I wanted to know was from someone that had cheated on their mate....how long they tried to get them back before giving up. I know there is a lot of cheaters/excheaters out there that could answer that question. Hope I don't get bashed again. I know there is more than one question here so you can answer all or none. Just please don't bash me, I did nothing wrong. I was the good person!!</content>

<subject>legal eagle:My daughter was assaulted at school and they deny that it happened.?</subject><content>My daughter was bitten in art class and was told by her assaulant not to tell because no one would believe her.  The biter left her upper and lower impressions and the scare remains.  The school and church sided with the biters parents and went on to issue them a letter of support, in which lies and confidential imformation was shared about my family.  We managed to get a judgment for medical expenses from the bitters parents.  However, the school and church sided and announced in this correspondance that my daughter would not be attending school this year based on our financial hardship, and advised the bitters parents not to seek resolution because the incidnet never took place.  Do I have recourse as far as recovering registration cost and slanderous remarks made against my family.  Does a private school have responsibility to file an incident report or expel my daughters attacker, under the Ohio Revised Code?  Can anything be done to make the school or principal responsible?</content>

<subject>Should I Ask Her Out Again?</subject><content>Ok so I'm 17 and towards the end of last school year(like April/May) I was trying to go out with this girl(she's a grade younger). We knew each other from school but not that well. She lives a couple blocks away so I randomly went over one day and we went for a walk around the lake and we had a good time. The next week I asked her to hang out and she said yea and she gave me her number. But when i called she said she was busy and I tried twice more in the following weeks but I was out of luck. I never really understood what went wrong, I thought she was into me but then she seemed to just shut off. So I took the hint and left it alone, but now I kinda have a crush on her again and I want to give it another shot, but I'm not sure what to do. I mean, if she liked me then she had her chance so maybe there's no point. And I wouldn't want to ask her again and then have to go through the same charades as last year, plus, it would probably be awkard to bring up again. Any advice?</content>

<subject>Is it "excellent" to hate people who dont believe in Allah?</subject><content>Quran 60:4 ““(allah instructs) there is for you an excellent example…(abraham’s example) “we have rejected you, and there has arisen, between us and you, enmity and hatred for ever,- unless ye believe in allah”” http://www.usc.edu/dept/msa/quran/060.qmt.html#060.004&#xa;&#xa;In the beggining of this aya (verse) the supposed voice of Allah announces the the following is an "excellent example". Allah then describes a time when Ibrahim declared "hatred" for the unbelievers "unless you believe in Allah".&#xa;&#xa;Do you think this is an excellent example of behavior as the Quran claims? If you do believe this is excellent behavior, I would love to know what you think bad behavior is?&#xa;&#xa;Why does Allah think its excellent to hate people simply because they dont yet believe in his religion?  Couldnt Allah have said "but if they had no way to knoweth Allah before the invading Muslims came upon them, then hateth them not, ye may still kill them, but in their ignorance they deserve not you hatred".</content>

I had to write that, because I called in the first place saying I was him. Later on, I called as myself. In the report I wanted it to look as if he began the calls, and I  took over, when I got in the  fall out with the sargent.&#xa; Later on, a great sargent helped me out, once the DMV paperwork  was straightened out, and the car was given back at no charge.

<subject>What should I do?</subject><content>What should I do about my feelings for him?&#xa;I have a crush on a male/guy friend or coworker at work. At first, I thought he was interested in me since he would tease me and flirt with me a lot. He would even send me emails that contained romantic songs and kept asking if I had a bf. Then I told him, that I liked him and he told me he has a gf. I tell myself that he is unavailable and that we can still be friends. Sometimes I email him at work, but then he told me that I should stop emailing him since he was getting the impression that I was sending him a lot of emails because I like him. I know he isn't the one for me since he's in luv with someone else and we are too different anyway. But then sometimes I cry in the middle of the night about him. He still teases me throughout the work day, by making funny faces, but I kinda prefer he stop. What should I do about my feelings for him? Remember, I see him at work everyday, and our desks are situated close to each other, so we are bound to run into each othe</content>

<subject>Patricia Heaton (Everybody Loves Raymond)?</subject><content>Two-parter:&#xa;&#xa;Why do guys think she's so beautiful that they have to express it in graphic?... or dirty ways? I'm not sure of the term I'm looking for, but they really seem to think she's beautiful and I'm just wondering what guys see in her. I'm not saying she's not pretty. I think she's very pretty. I just never knew people had such feelings about her as the ones I've seen on different message boards like Patricia's IMDb board or the different YouTube comments. Check them out and you'll see what I mean. What are your feelings towards her?&#xa;&#xa;Also, if anyone is a fan of Patricia, what kind of tv shows or movies would you like to see her in? Something more dramatic or another "comedic" role?</content>

<subject>What happens if stitches are left in?</subject><content>I had stitches removed 3 weeks after having a cyst removed from my chest a week before that.  The wound did not heal.  It was leaking clear, red and creamy fluid.  I went back to the doctor and he cauterized the area and said that there was a stitch left in.  He cut the stitch out and said that the silver nitrate used in cauterization would help dry up the wound and help it to heal.  This morning when I woke up, the silver nitrate had started to lift up and I can notice that there is still more clear, red and creamy fluid under the layer of silver nitrate.  Should I still be concerned?  How can I tell if more stitches were still left in?  My doctor is only there on Wednesday so even if I called to the office, I would only be able to talk to a nurse who would just say that they will leave a message for the doctor (because that is what they have done before).</content>

<subject>Brandon Lloyd vs. Reggie Williams vs. Doug Gabriel?</subject><content>Who of the three should I start?  I'm stuck between starting two of these three receivers, seeing that my studs are on a bye.  Lloyd looks good because Moss is out for the Dallas game, so he should be getting a lot of balls his way from Brunell.  Williams started off hot, but cooled down the last few weeks which has gotten him a lot of questions.  I expect he'll blow up this week.  Then there's Gabriel... Tom Brady is playing arch-nemesis Peyton Manning this week, so I expect him to try and throw all day.  Gabriel is probably his favorite target.  Basically, i'm stuck! Help!  Who of the three would you all pick?  Remember... Lloyd doesn't have that much fantasy power so far this year, but there's no Moss. Don't just let that fact alter your opinion.  I need help to stay on top of my league. Thanks!</content>

<subject>warfarin &amp; bleeding?</subject><content>I take warfarin (5mg weekdays, 6mg Sat &amp; Sunday). I recently had a routine urine test at the atrial fibrillation clinic at my local doctors' surgery. The sample look absolutely clear but the dip stick turned blue on the end &amp; I was told I had blood in the urine. The latest test has stayed the same. A sample was sent to the hospital and the result was that nothing untoward was found. As I still have the blood (or haemoglobin as he now calls it) my doctor has sent another sample, to the Cystology (or was it cytology?)  department - this time for a fuller test and I am now worried. A doctor friend of mine has said that warfarin could be causing the blood. Has anyone else had blood in the urine caused by warfarin?</content>

<subject>Seriously, is there a true battle for our souls happening right now?  I am truly getting freaked out.?</subject><content>I still have extremely spiritual dreams, and I am sought out now.  While in a laundrymat,  a woman and I started up a conversation about religion.  She convinced me to come to her church that Sunday, and I definitely can say that I felt something there.  I wanted to join that church, but after the service my sister was waiting at my brothers home that I was visiting to bring me back home to my mom's.  I never got to join that church, never even got to go back to that town.  Recently, with friends in a store, I passed an old woman heading out.  She came back in, and said that when she had passed me earlier, "the spirit" made her follow me inside.  She grabbed my hands, prayed for me, asked if I knew I was being called.  She begged me to take her number, to call her that night.  She was crying when she left.  My friends laughed it off.  I don't know what happened to the number, it disappeared.  I left out a lot of details, and this has happened more that twice.  Overactive imagination?</content>

<subject>Is she into me, or just having fun . . .?</subject><content>Ok - this is a girl that I have known for a long time.  We've known each other about 10 years.  I was married (spouse died) but I've always had a crush on her.  I finally got the nerve to ask her out, and she agreed, but because I was married before she said she never thought of me that way.  I asked her out, and we had a great time together.  We've been on 4 dates, and we seem to spark with each other – at least I feel them – shes very outgoing and we hold hands and such.  We've kissed several times, and the kisses are great, but I do notice at the end of the night she tends to pull away from the kiss after a few seconds. . . We talk on the telephone, but the conversations are usually short . . .  I'm just not sure if she's really into me or not.  I sent her flowers Friday and she texted me to say thanks . . .  While the acknowledgement was good, wouldn't a call have been more personable or am I just being over sensitive to this?</content>

Recently he has been having just short out bursts of painfully crying and then it goes away, there isn't anything leading up to or following as far as being upset.  He has no signs of anything wrong, he is eating and keeping everything down, not that he has ever had a problem keeping anything down, he is still active and energetic, there doesn't seem to be any bumps or bruises anywhere or any type of swelling.  He is sleeping well and everything else seems to be great.  He bumped his head square on a piece of base trim about 2 weeks ago and that seems to have healed and when it happened the swelling came out and not in.  With all of this information is this just a way of getting attention or is there something here we need to worry about?</content>

<subject>Soceity vs. my life?</subject><content>45 yr attractive female. Divorced. Kids grown up and on their own. I dated/lived with a man for 5 yrs. Left due to verbal abuse, fighting, sucking my soul dry. 2 yrs later we are dating again. He's changed(really!) and wants to get married, buy a house, travel, live happily everafter....EVERYTHING I wanted when we were together but he wouldn't commit. Now he says he doesn't ever want to lose me again, emotionally available, basically everything a woman would want.&#xa;I am torn between being 45...I should have the husband, house, etc. &#xa;I like him but don't love him the way I did before...maybe too much pain. I'm not excited, just okay. I don't laugh or smile much with him..I'm bored.&#xa;I could pay off my debts, help my kids(college), get a new car desperately needed, house, etc. Everything I want. Everything soceity thinks I should do. Or I can keep it the way it is and live payck to payck and be alone in my apartment and maybe meet someone new eventually. &#xa;Advice/thoughts??</content>

I looked into using DVD's and NAS devices, but I think I can also just get a new 80GB Ipod and use it as both a portable device and my main back up for my purchased stuff. Other files, like word and excel I back up using my .MAC I-disk, but the music and video files required much more space and bandwidth, so I have to back up localy. &#xa;&#xa;If I have to do a restore, will I be able to restore off of an IPOD?</content>

<subject>HELP!  I'm in a sticky situation?</subject><content>Alright, i'm sure there are TONS of questions like this out there but every situation is different so here goes...i've fallen for a man that already has a girlfriend.  We've been friends for several months and then before i know it we are talking on the phone for hours, sneaking off at work to spend time with eachother and talking about our feelings for one another.  From what he tells me the deal with them is that they've been together for a long time, 4 years, and they live in the same house together.  He works nights, and she works days so they literally don't spend any time together at all.  There is no intimacy, they don't really say a whole lot to eachother and when they do she's usually on his case about something.  NOW here is the tricky part, HE says it's just easier to go through the motions this way than disrupting the routine they have, they also have a son together so splitting up with probably get pretty tricky.  And yes i have thought about all of this A LOT</content>

<subject>The HYDROGEN ECONOMY?</subject><content>I recently heard a politician say that the hydrogen economy is still 20 years away - due to the cost that companies like Shell, BP etc would face in developing the technology eg the expense of R&amp;D and the cost of installing the infrasture to make H2 widely available.&#xa;&#xa;Sadly this was also echoed by an industry insider.&#xa;&#xa;Well, if commercial entities as large as Shell and BP are hesitant to invest (whatever the real reason behind their procrastination) and as a result there is a 20 year time lag until we get clean motoring, then....&#xa;&#xa;Q: Isn't this a perfect example of where a nationalised industry should be created?  (Very much like the nuclear power industry was created in this country in the second half of last century.)  Why can't the Government do that again with the Hydrogen economy?  The UK has the money needed to invest; and the right  people, to make this a reality.  The technology export potential is huge and once installed and functioning here, we could privatise it!</content>

<subject>My little Brother who is in 6th grade was beaten up by an 8th grader, what do I do?</subject><content>My brother was riding his bus and sitting next to this kid who he was joking around with. My little brother who is just 5ft and 58lbs, playfully punched this 8th grader in the arm. The 8th grader then proceded to stand up and kick my brother to the floor where he recieved: a large bump on his head from hitting the floor, several cuts on his face where he was kicked, and a broken wrist. I want to hurt this kid, but I dont want to go to jail. I would press charges but because it happened on the bus, its in the school district's authority. Unfortunatly I live in an area with a Zero Tolerance policy, thus because my brother jokingly hit this kid in the shoulder who he was playing around with he would be subject to the same punishment as this sadist who would hurt someone two years his junior so badly. I want to know, should I take the punishment of the law and teach this kid a lesson, should I go to court, or should I just let the whole issue drop. Keep in mind that I am 16 and a minor.</content>

<subject>A question about Beyonce's "B'Day"?</subject><content>It's been two months since Beyonce's sophomore effort "B'Day" came out. The debut single "Deja Vu" featuring her man Jay-Z peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100. But unfortunately, the second single wasn't lucky enough to enter into the Top 10, and it even fell down very soon on the chart. The 3rd single "Irreplaceable" has come into the chart for its second week and leaped to #24 this week. Don't know if it would start to fall the next week. Compared to her previous singles from the first album, two #1 and two Top 5 hits, I would like to know what's wrong with her new songs? Don't Americans like her new style of music anymore though her album was sold kinda well this time? Please anwer me. (if you are an American, that'd be much better for you to answer this question.)</content>

Now remember the loin and remember how fast he is and remember also there is 2 of them. I want you to think really good about this and i want you to picture it very well in your mind. Would you shoot your self and never see the time that your love will be eaten by the loins or would you shoot one loin and Russell the other loin willing to make her escape and you die, or you shoot her before she feels the pain behind the loins teeth. The problem is none of these that i mentioned is the right solution LOL. yeb it is not. what i want you to give me is how will you and your love escape that room to the door with out any scratch ??!!! and remember there is one loin in front of you and one in the back?

Heres the thing he asked me out to a movie a couple months back and ever since then we have talked non-stop.  So he recently asked me to go to another movie (so excited) and were going to the school play together in December.  Just so you know he doesn't make plans in advance and he asked me to a play a month away.  He even asked me if I wanted to go skating once he found his skates.  So I would think all the signs point to he likes me too.  Heres the thing I like him and I am pretty sure that he likes me so should I let the age difference come between us, even if that means disappointing my parents?</content>

<subject>If religion is so "right", why did it have to FORCE itself on mankind?</subject><content>with threats and bribes?  Lets face it, the thing that kept (and keeps) most people "religious" for the better part of two millenia was fear.  Fear of eternal damnation, fear of excommunication, fear of inquisitions, of heresy.&#xa;&#xa;When the fear card was all used up, religion switched to bribery.  Eternal joy, eternal salvation, etc.  And now, as people get smarter and smarter and see the control mechanisms for what they are, even the bribery is starting to lose its allure.&#xa;&#xa;Decade after decade, century after century, religion keeps making tired promises it can't deliver.  Remember all the wild stories of the Rapture in Y2K?  Remember the mass converts following 9-11?  Where are all the prognosticators and "fair-weather" faithful now?  Skulking around with their tails between their legs since Christ never came, and our way of life didn't screech to a halt following a tragedy.&#xa;&#xa;How can intelligent, educated people fail to see religion for the crutch that it is?&#xa;&#xa;Or, maybe they do?</content>

<subject>What's the best way to save for multiple savings goals at the same time?</subject><content>I'd like to start multiple "fake" accounts so that I can instantly mark money as reserved for a future expense. So if my "house maintenance" account has enough money in it, I can start my next home repair project. Or if my "entertainment" account has enough, I can go out and buy that shiny new road bike.&#xa;&#xa;In other words, I'd like to treat my savings account as multiple accounts. Then each account would receive a certain percentage each month. &#xa;&#xa;It's sort of like a pro-active budget, but I need a way of saying I have $x set aside for goal y at any point in time. Most budgets (that I've seen) only tell you there are $x remaining this month/year for goal y.&#xa;&#xa;I'd like to a number of categories, so I don't think opening a new savings account for each would be very practical.&#xa;&#xa;Any ideas? What are you all doing for things like this? Do any banks offer something like this? Any software?</content>

<subject>Obtaining an EU passport for Germany-born American?</subject><content>I was born in West Germany in 1981 to two US-born Americans.  My understanding is that I am not elligible for a German passport because my parents were not German, regardless of me being born there having a German birth certificate, and spending the first 7 years of my life in Germany.  &#xa;&#xa;Does anyone know if the German citizenship law is to be amended at any point, or if I might ever be elligible for a general "EU passport" because I was born in an EU country?  Is there anything I can do, or am I stuck?&#xa;&#xa;I would like to go back and live and work in Europe again, not necessarily in Germany, but having this passport would let me live in any EU country.  My connections to Europe are strong, and I feel confused as to why being born in Germany does not count for anything.  It seems to me that being born there should entitle one to citizenship, especially since the country's population is decreasing.  &#xa;&#xa;Thank you for any help.</content>

<subject>I have a shubunkin and a black moor, who comes next?</subject><content>I posted a similar question a while ago and after some research, I am now looking for a new opinion.  I have a shubunkin named Stewie and a black moor name Colby.  I just got a new 29 gallon tank.  I would like to get them one more friend.  Now someone here has said that these 2 types should be seperated, but they get along well.  They were in the same tank when I bought them, and I would prefer not to seperate these babies.  Saying all this, what would be an appropriate choice for a third goldie.  I am thinking maybe a comet or another moor?  Maybe a Ryukin?  I am not too sure.  I'd appreciate some input.&#xa;&#xa;Thanks!</content>

<subject>Should I even try to get him back?</subject><content>My ex broke up with me about two months ago. I really liked him a lot so the break up is hard for me. It was NOT a nice break up either so it kinda irks me how he acts so nonchalant about it.   In the interim he has been sending me text messages asking me how I am, what i am doing ect... I haven't repsonded or any of them nor have I contacted him on my own.  Last week he sent me a text asking me how my halloween was and if he could come over to my house to get his computer and stuff.  After a day or so I called him back and told him that I didn't mind if he came and got his things.  He tried to keep me on the phone to talk but I kept it simple and got off.  He's suppose to come over on Saturday. The part of me that still loves him wants to try and work things out but the realistic side of me is telling me let it go. We haven't seen each other since the break up. Do I owe it to  myself to try or should I just let it be?</content>

They were in the foster care &amp; were abandoned by birth family.  We hoped that our love and compassion would fill the empty hole in her heart.  She has been a problem since we got her, in trouble at school, dropped out in 10th grade and arrested twice for underage drinking.  We have provided years of counseling and medication for ADHD and borderline Personality disorder.  She will not work, sleeps all day goes out with anyone she can meet on myspace, comes home high and drunk and wakes her Dad and I in the middle of night when she knows we have to work during the day. We had given her several warnings in writing that if she continued her behavior we would have to kick her out.  We finally did it 2 weeks ago and took her to an extended stay motel, we have paid the bill and brought her food.  She still refuses to work or help herself. She will not enter any program. Should we cut her off?</content>

At Company B I am being reqruited by a client that has been a mentor to me over the past few years. I feel that this job will position me well for the career switch that I am looking for. My client is devastated that they were not able to put their offer on the table in enough time and I accepted with Company A.&#xa;&#xa;I want to work with Company B but am wondering how unethical/unprofessional it would be for me to renege on the acceptance that I gave to Company A.</content>

<subject>Can I re-open this Wake co. N.C judgement?</subject><content>Joe bought farm in 1937, he also bargained for 8 more acres, but never paid owners, 1958 Joe sold farm plus 8 acres he bargained for to Martha, she in turn gave deed of entire farm to her son in 1972, in 1976 Joe decided he would buy the other 8 acres from his brothers. Joe purchased these lots and decided he wanted his two sons to  have this property at his death, his will  stated this.  1984 Joe died, Martha immediately went to court and got judgement for her to take all the land including lots purchased in 1976 left to his sons, In 2005 the son found out there was a will leaving him all real and personal property. These lots still deeded in his dad's name, does he have any legal course to get the land his dad left him. The will and lot deeds not included in 1984 judgement, because son did not know he had written will in 1976 and recorded in Wake Court House. Joe was illiterate, he stated to any and everyone  that he never signed nothing but Will .</content>
<subject>why are women expected to do so much more than men, in a relationship?</subject><content>Does  anyone else ever question womens roles in the family today? Why are women expected to have a full time job, bring home income, do at least 90% of the housework and be the primary parent in child raising??????? Women are told they are not OK unless they do it all.............WHY??????? Women had a more equatable deal in the old days, if you ask me. Men are not expected to do it all............. You almost always hear about some woman who has a full time job and does everything else in the home BUT, you almost never hear of a man doing 90% of the housework and his full time job.&#xa;&#xa;I think women were much better off with the way things were in the past. Womens lib was not a win win  situation. Women are being abused even more in my opinion..........What do you think?</content>

<subject>CHRISTIANS:  How rational is blood sacrifice for attonement??</subject><content>How rational is it for God to sacrifice 'his own innocent son' and he cannot even punish the evil doers who sin all over the earth?&#xa;&#xa;The bible requires a blood sacrifice:&#xa;And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission. (Hebrews 9:22)&#xa;&#xa;&#xa;What does Jesus (peace be upon him) say about this matter:&#xa;&#xa;Jesus was teaching his disciples in the outer court of the Temple and one of them said unto him: Master, it is said by the priests that without shedding of blood there is no remission. Can then the blood offering of the law take away sin? And Jesus answered: No blood offering, of beast or bird, or man, can take away sin, for how can the conscience be purged from sin by the shedding of innocent blood? Nay, it will increase the condemnation. (Gospel of the Nazorenes, Lection 33, verses 1-2)&#xa;&#xa;I find it impossible for a man to offer himself for sacrifice for 'the sins of mankind' when he condemns sacrifice himself.</content>

<subject>Irreversible damage to a little boy?</subject><content>when I was 5 to 8 yrs my family(uncles, cousins etc..) did not like my little brother He was just 2 years older than me. He suffered from epilepsy and He would be too hyperactive. He was rejected, insulted and left alone for many years. When my little sister was born she got all the attention! I would cry at night because I hated discrimination and insults and I felt helpless. I wanted to stand up for my brother and beat u everybody who would dare to insult him...He is 16yrs now and he is a very bright young adult..but He grew up hating my sister and everybody who ever tells him something. He is also depressive and has a very low self esteem. I love my two siblings very much but I don't know what to do to reverse the damage....They fight all the time and we can't afford a therapist. Thank you!</content>

<subject>I have been introduced to this girl by my parents...?</subject><content>and i met up with her yesterday.  She is really nice, and i am keen to get to know her.  Any indians out there will understand that onve you've met someone in this way (and both mine and her parents know about it) and both like each other there will be expectations of marriage.  One of the things which concerns me is that i drink and eat meat, and she doesnt.  She doesnt even eat onions or garlic (shes Swaminarian).  Its not a big deal to me at the mo, but it might become a little frustrating in the future.  Id really like to get to know her, but i dont want to commit the rest of my life to her just yet.  By saying to parents that we like each other, they will inevitably say 'get engaged, and get married when you want'.  But what if in 3-6mnths we realise that we dont want to get married?  Any advice?&#xa;&#xa;Thanks in advance</content>

Do you think, It would have been right on my part to hide my age from him n should have married? If I cud have hidden, he wud have married coz we liked each other.I dont regret my action but at times the question comes, wud it have been right to marry him by keeping him in darkness.

<subject>I think we need to get rid of both parties?</subject><content>I say the leftists should generally vote Green, and the righties should vote Libertarian. Those should be the parties that dominate, and we can also have your socialist, constitution, and reform parties... I think we need sweeping reform of the political system, neither party has been able to control themselves. I think we need a line item veto amendment, we need a balanced budget amendment, and we need a lot of the laws that have been passed over the years overturned by the courts (i.e. drug laws). &#xa;&#xa;This may be a pipe dream, but our government is too big, too corrupt, and headed on a course towards bankruptcy. Something needs to be done. Anyone here agree with me?</content>

Six months ago we had the talk about marriage he said that he would propose in 2-3 months.  Now he says maybe in a year.  He says he loves me and that the only reason we aren't engaged is that  he has to come to and understanding in his mind about being a husband and that he isn't ready to give up his adult unmarried life.  He says there is no one else and  that he doesn't want to be with any one else and that it's not me but it's him.  We've lived together for a year and 2 months.  what should I do?  Should I just leave and give him his space because I get the feeling he just wants to have his cake and eat it too.  I love him and I know he loves me.  Please give me GREAT advice</content>

<subject>What is the "vacuum cleaner" noise I hear in my Ford Explorer?</subject><content>1998 Ford Explorer Sport, 4.0 V6, 5-speed, 140k...&#xa;My Explorer oftentimes, but intermittently makes a "vacuum cleaner" noise in the front end.  Also the rpms go up to 2000 even when idle in neutral.  When the noise quits, the rpms go way down, then it sputters a second like its going to quit, then returns to a normal idle.  It also does it while rolling, though it doesn't seem to depend on speed, gear, etc., but I do notice it much more when its cold.  Other than this, there are no other problems.  What could this be and do I need to be very concerned?  Also, would the repair be very costly?  The vehichle is getting old with pretty high mileage and may not be worth repairing.</content>

<subject>Does he or not??? (Click Here!!!)?</subject><content>We have a class together and he rides my bus. We talk and I am friends with his sister. But whenever I see him, I see him watching me and looking at me. My friend on bus thinks he likes me because she said, "He feel comfortable with you, and doesn't hesistate, and plus he is always looking at you." He is 1/2 year younger than I am, so would it be weird for a older person to ask a younger person out. In the hallways he follows me and talk to me all the time, but sometimes he waits for me....like today, his class is down the hall and my class is further away, so he told me he made he put everything away just to be in time to see me. He now has a girlfriend but is always complaining to me how she is so annoying and he is always looking at me. When I see him, he stares right at me and is really friendly. He is always flirty with girls that are right next to me and other than that he doesn't talk 2 them.You can ask question but I will not answer personal questions. (Example: names and etc.)</content>

<subject>Peanut problems...?</subject><content>Guy at home watching TV eating peanuts. He'd toss one, then catch it in his mouth. In the middle of catching one, his wife called him, and as he turned to answer, the peanut fell in his ear.&#xa;He and wife tried to dig it out but only pushed it in deeper. After hours of trying they became worried and decided to go to the hospital. Just about to leave the door, their daughter came home with her date. Telling him of the problem, their daughter's date said he could get the peanut out. The young man told the father to sit down, then shoved two fingers up the father's nose and told him to blow hard. Father blew, out it came. Mother and daughter jumped for joy. The young man insisted that it was nothing and the daughter brought the young man out to the kitchen for something to eat. Once gone the mother turned to the father and said, "Great! - isn't he smart? What do you think he's going to be when he grows older?" The father replied, "From the smell of his fingers, our son-in-law!"</content>

Try walking past the yard though and you were in trouble.&#xa;&#xa;That's the only time in my life I've ever seen that kind of dog and I've never heard it mentioned in dog circles....and that was 30 years ago!  Is this breed still around?  I'm not interested in getting one, I just wonder why it isn't common around here and if it thrives somewhere else.  Anyone own one of these dogs?  Do they all live in France?  LOL...</content>

<subject>Hubby won't argue fairly and blows-up over stupid stuff?</subject><content>I have a very stubborn husband who rarely gives me the chance to voice my opinion in an argument, or if I do, he doesn't listen, never looking at me. Recently, we had 2 arguments in the last two weeks. The first one, he had a bad day, and so when we got home he lashed out at me, nitpicking on me and so on. The second one he was trying to fix a table lamp and yelled at me because a: he couldn't find the screwdriver, that I gave back to him cuz it stayed on my table for 3 weeks, and b: cuz it wasn't plugged in. This all seems kind of stupid, and it is, but he is out of control. He never apologizes before we go to bed, and I end up going to sleep in the other room. He is so stubborn he doesn't want to talk about it. How do I calm him down, and get him to argue more fairly? None of this was any of my fault.</content>

I dont know, i always end up going home with "her" on the first date... knowing well ahead that I just want to get to know her.. and take some time before doing anything.

It just gets really frustrating when my knees slip out of joint. it is VERY painful (sometimes worse than others). I've been doing physical therapy but after a whole summer of P.T. and almost no sports or highly ogressive physical activity, my knees seem worse than ever before. I was wondering if anybody knew of any very good P.T. excerizes, as mine don't seem to be working, and if there was any way to prevent my knee from slipping out during basketball.</content>

<subject>Does this sound like an eating disorder or something else?</subject><content>For the past few months, I've been oddly concerned about germs. I won't eat anything with my hands until I've washed them really, really well. Then if I go in a different room and touch anything, I have to wash them again before I can continue eating.  When I take a dish or something out of the cupboard I have to rinse it off under the water before I can eat off of it.  I'm also overly concerned about food poisoning, so I'm constantly checking expiration dates and worrying about food being cooked enough.  I refuse to eat leftovers after one day because I'm afraid they're not safe.  Is this really abnormal, like obsessive-compulsive sounding? Because that's what I'm starting to think....</content>

<subject>Misunderstanding?</subject><content>Little Johnny was busy doing his homework. As his mother approached she heard: &#xa;"One and one, the son-of-a-bitch is two."&#xa;"Two and two, the son-of-a-bitch is four."&#xa;"Three and three... " &#xa;His mother interrupted, asking where he had learned this way of doing math. Little Johnny remarked that his teacher Ms. Margo taught him. &#xa;His mother was rather upset and told him to stop the homework. The next day she stormed into Little Johnny's classroom and confronted Ms. Margo. Little Johnny's mother told Ms. Margo about Little Johnny's different way of doing math, and his claims that Ms. Margo taught it that way to the class. &#xa;The teacher was flabbergasted. She said that she couldn't understand why Little Johnny had said what he did. Then suddenly, Ms Margo exclaimed, "Oh, I know, here in school we say, one and one, the sum-of-which is two." &#xa;  &#xa;&#xa;&#xa;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</content>

The girl's father will say to the elders, 'I gave my daughter in marriage to this man, but he dislikes her. Now he has slandered her and said I did not find your daughter to be a virgin. But here is the proof of my daughter's virginity.' Then her parents shall display the cloth before the elders of the town, and the elders shall take the man and punish him. They shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver and give them to the girl's father, because this man has given an Israelite virgin a bad name. She shall continue to be his wife; he must not divorce her as long as he lives. If, however, the charge is true and no proof of the girl's virginity...</content>
<subject>What would you do if you loved your best friend so much that you couldn't get her off your mind?</subject><content>I'm a 17 year old in high school (male), and I'm in love with my best friend. She's the smartest, most beautiful person I've ever met, and i just can't get her off my mind. Just thinking about her makes me smile. I've tried to tell her how I feel, though not outright. You know, I've hinted at it and said things that a friend probably doesn't say to a friend, but she's oblivious to how i feel about her. For God's sake, my parents know that I love her just because of how I act with her... I just don't see how she doesn't. I mean come on, when's the last time you spent 5 hours talking with a friend, telling her things you've never told anyone before? And when's the last time she did the same back to you? When's the last time you told your friend your deepest fears and dreams; the last time you talked with a friend as though you were emptying your soul to an angel? I don't know anymore... What would you do if you were me?</content>

<subject>How much should sex be worth in a marriage?</subject><content>"If you want more sex, then how about you be more romantic or help out more so I'm not so tired from doing everything?"&#xa;This is a form bartering for services "you do this for me and I'll do this for you". &#xa;Ideally a man and woman should be romantic and/or sexual with their spouse because they want to, but I've been seeing more and more questions from a spouse saying that they are already doing everything and still their spouse is not having sex with them.  &#xa;Is it that their spouse has over valued sex and is wanting too much before putting out?&#xa;And should the spouse stop paying (ie. cleaning, being romantic, date night ...etc) until sex has returned to a more fair market value?&#xa;&#xa;In a closed market environment like marriage the buyer and seller each can adjust the value of bartered services (in this case sex) easily by either with holding the service or payment.  &#xa;&#xa;So what should sex be worth in a marriage?

<subject>33 year-old female with somekind of popping in lower back or private area no pain.?</subject><content>lost 50lbs a year ago. started feeling and hearing somekind of popping sound in my lower back or pelvis(private area) not sure exactly where it is comming from. does not hurt but i am concerned b/c its not normal. usually happens when bent over at the waist and either doing something with my hands like picking up stuff off the floor or applying pressure like trying to unscrew a tight bolt or also when bent over and i shift my weight from one side to the other. oh yeah also (hope this is not to personal) when having sex while laying on my side w/husband on side behind me(spooning)the upper thrust will also make it pop. i'm wondering if something is out of alignment or bones rubbing together or if being overweight for along time then losing weight did something.</content>

<subject>Video Camcorder for a 65 year old man?</subject><content>I want to purchase a video camera for my father who will be 65 in February.  It has to be something that won't be too hard for him to understand.  He likes mechanical things, but he does not own a computer, so it cannot be anything he has to hook up to a computer.  Is there anything you would recommend that would be simple for him to use that he can use on video tapes?  He does have a VCR.  I want one that isn't too cheap and not too expensive.  I would like some opinions on brand names that will last and any recommendations and to battery life etc.  Thank you in advance.</content>

<subject>funny or not  or just classic?</subject><content>A blonde who got a fishing rod for her birthday decided to go ice fishing to make good use of her gift. Early the next morning, she got all her gear together and headed out to the ice.&#xa;&#xa;When she reached her final destination, she cut a large hole in the ice and dipped the rod in. Then suddenly she heard a voice that said: "There are no fish in there".&#xa;&#xa;So she moves to another spot and cuts another hole, but then the same voice spoke again and told her there were no fish in there.&#xa;&#xa;So she moves again, and the voice tells her there are no fish in there. So she looks up and sees an irritated man staring down at her.&#xa;&#xa;"How do you know there are no fish there?" asks the blonde.&#xa;&#xa;So the man cooly says " this is a hockey rink,&#xa;&#xa;&#xa;what do you see when you gaze into a blondes eyes?&#xa;the back of her head&#xa;&#xa;How do you make a blonde laugh on Saturday?&#xa; Tell her a joke on Wednesday.</content>

It is unique and that is its appeal.  Any die hard gamer would play RPGs and Shooters on a computer anyway because you can upgrade every year  as opposed to once a decade.  I have ben using the graphics that PS3 achieves for a year now on my dual core AMD with 2GB of Ram and 512 MB graphics card.  Get a life?  I got a Wii because it looks interesting and is reasonably priced for a console.  It is a new type of system, and not just an upgraded PS2 (it is truly revolutionary!)</content>

<subject>Where to draw the line when it comes to cheating?</subject><content>Okay everyone. Everyone knows that if you have a boy/girlfriend or a husband/wife and you have sex with someone else, that is considered cheating. But, in today's world, there are so many steps we all go through when it comes to relationships. So, my question is, where is your 'cheating line'? &#xa;&#xa;For example, if someone is going through the steps of divorce and they have sex with someone else, is this considered cheating? if someone is taking 'a break' from a relationship, would you call this cheating? If someone kisses another person, is this cheating? &#xa;&#xa;Where do you draw the line?</content>

When I described the symptoms to my father, he said it was probably strut rubbers coming out of alignement (he doesn't speak English, so I don't know how well I translated these terms). &#xa;Can anybody give me a ballpark estimate how much might it cost to fix it? I mean, are we talking a couple of hundreds, several hundreds, thousands? I don't want to waste my time getting a mechanic's estimate if I won't be able to afford it at this time.</content>

<subject>Thoughts on this article (immigration)?</subject><content>From an on-line article from KTRK-Channel 13 (Houston)&#xa;&#xa;&#xa;&#xa;First in Texas&#xa;A suburb of Dallas could soon be the first city in Texas to adopt an ordinance to keep illegal immigrants out. The city council in Farmers Branch will consider the proposal Monday. It includes banning landlords from leasing to illegal immigrants, penalizing businesses that employ undocumented workers, and making English the city's official language. Other towns across the country have adopted similar ordinances, including more than a dozen in Pennsylvania and some in California. &#xa;(Copyright © 2006, KTRK-TV)</content>
<subject>Can you tell the Hot Difference?</subject><content>A guy &amp; a girl meet at a bar. They get along so well that they decide to go to the girl's place. A few drinks later, the guy takes off his shirt and then washes his hands. He then takes of his trousers and washes his hands again. The girl has been watching him and says, "You must be a dentist." The guy, surprised, says "Yes....how did you figure that out?" "Easy," she replied, "you keep washing your hands." One thing led to another and they make love. After they have done, the girl says, "You must be a good dentist." The guy, now with a boosted ego says, "Sure, I'm a good dentist, how did you figure that out?" "Didn't feel a thing!"</content>
<subject>Catholics say Peter was the first Pope?</subject><content>Why do Catholics not follow after Peter's teachings if he indeed was their first Pope? Or is it just a matter of...that being history and time has passed and things have changed and you don't have to follow his teachings anymore?&#xa;&#xa;Peter said everyone needs to repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.&#xa;Not all catholics have the Holy Ghost, because tongues is given as proof to that and they don't speak in tongues.&#xa;Also, from what I know they don't baptize in Jesus name...but Peter said to baptize that way.&#xa;&#xa;Not only that, but again...from what I've heard, Catholics pray to Mary and...other various dead people. Why? "Have no other God's before me" and other scriptures say that same thing, yet Catholics PRAY to dead people!&#xa;I know any catholic I've talked to in person cannot describe why they "believe" the way they believe, but they cannot be the first church as they say cuz they don't follow the ways of the first church in the bible.</content>

<subject>Can I be pregnant?</subject><content>Before I start my menstrual periods, usually 8 days before my periods I have PMS, but this time around, some mornings I had new symptoms like I was nauseous one early morning around 5am and lately I've been having lower back aches and as well as soreness in my right shoulder.  Not all days, but few hrs every 3 days I would be crampy and moody.  Then, I've been a bit tired than usual as well as some days my body temperature rises, but then goes away, but then comes back later.  Can anybody tell me if these are signs of pregnancy?  If not, can you tell me what's going on with my body?  I'm in my mid 20's and is trying to concieve.  My period was suppose to start this past weekend, but didn't happen.  I'm waiting till the 35th or 36th day to take E.P.T test.  Those thing costs like $20 for one test so don't want to waste money either.  Also, I've been indulging on pickles cause my body has been craving for them!!</content>

<subject>Does anyone know anything about LCPD or Legg Calve  Perthes Disease?</subject><content>We were told my 3 year old grandson has it almost a year ago and that his bone to his hip is completely dead and all we could do was watch him and do x-rays to watch for changes. 2 weeks ago after the x-rays he told us to cut his activities back and give him Motrin 2 to 3 times a day. No jumping, climbing,kicking, sliding or any kind of playground activities.This will be for years. He said this is the beginning of the critical time for him. I know this disease is rare and I just wonder if there are many people out there with kids this young and how do you deal with with slowing them down. We have adopted him and he is a little 100% boy always climbing and running and it is so hard to get him to slow down. He does not understand that it will hurt him. If anyone knows anything about this disease I would like to hear from you. Thank  You..</content>

<subject>Help! My fiance and I started a business together so now we're working together but we're not good cooworkers.</subject><content>I don't know what to do. My fiance and I opened a business together, and the business is doing VERY well. But we just CAN NOT work well together. Every day we're fighting. I'm crying. We take issues home with us. We're never getting along. this is supposed to be the best time of our lives! Plannig our wedding. But lately, I can hardly stand to cuddle with him or much less get intimate with him because of all the resentments I have againt him from work!!!! No matter how many times we try and talk about issues that come up, we both see them differently, and the same situation will be remembered differently from both up us. It's a dead end road. Working together may be temporary until I get another job, or he goes back to a previous one... or maybe we can work this out ( hopefully we can work this out and just keep working together ) either way, we're going to have to figure something out together for the next few months at least. Can someone help us please? Thanks! I'd appreciate it!</content>

<subject>In a multi-cultural, multi-faith world, what year should calendars designate as "YEAR 1"?</subject><content>Modern calendars are based on the (erroneous but commonly believed) year of Jesus birth. This is 2006; presumptively Jesus 2006th birthday is this year. With each usage, we subtly indicate that we are living in a Christian time. &#xa;&#xa;While the terms BC and AD are on their way out and replaced with BCE (Before Common Era) and CE (Common Era), it nonetheless remains that the calendar is centered on Jesus birth.&#xa;&#xa;SO.... in a multicultural / multifaith world, what year should we choose as year 1? What event is so definitive across human culture that it deserves to be cited forever more as the beginning of our current era?</content>

<subject>Is there a way to convert grams to mililiters?</subject><content>I am traveling to Europe. New airline laws require only a maximum of 100 ml each fluid/gel medications to be carried on board.  The several tubes of medication I recently got from my pharmacist are labeled either 15 grams or 30 grams, not in ml's. Since USA is WAY, WAY behind of using the metric system consistently, I have no idea if the 15 gram or the 30 gram tubes exceed the 100 mililiters limit. Can anyone help me?  Thanks :)</content>

<subject>Some Baby Dust advice based on personal experience...?</subject><content>Some Baby Dust advice from the "trick-or-treat" mom!!!!?&#xa;When I was growing up, I had very irregular periods. I wasn't sexually active, but I went 9 mos one time without a period (obviously not pregnant). I was actually very irregular until I got married.(and started having sex). But because of my irregularity I was very worried I wouldn't be able to have kids.&#xa;After we had been married for 8 mos, we started trying to have kids. We were only 20 and 21 when we got married. And then 20 and 22 when we got pregnant with our daughter!&#xa;We were seperated during the day and overnight because of some military training I was in. But as soon as school was out, I'd jog over to his hotel, and we'd get busy, several times in each sitting. I'm not trying to be too graphic, I just feel that if you hear about someone getting pregnant from so much sex, you won't worry about replenishing sperm...granted low sperm count isn't an issue. So, within a month, we were pregnant.&#xa;After my daughter was born (7mos ago) I went on birth control. Definitely didn't... &#xa;&#xa;Additional Details&#xa;&#xa;24 minutes ago&#xa;want another baby that soon! But, in the first week of October, we started trying to conceive. I was really nervous because I really wanted to get pregnant fast! and since I'd never been on BC, I was worried about how it had affected my fertility. That's how I found this Yahoo Q&amp;A thing. And I started doing research. I found this GREAT product called PreSeed. It's a lubricant like KY, but It's made to support sperm activity. In case you don't know, KY can create a barrier that hinders the sperm, Don't try to use it as a contraceptive, but if you aren't TTC, It's a great product....Cheaper to. But the PreSeed was well worth it. I must have bought about 12 tests in the last month!! I started to "feel" like I might be pregnant around the 12th of october. So, I started testing. I came back negative. Then, on the 24th, I decided to just get a blood test done. Negative.&#xa;Then, on the 30th, I was supposed to get my period. Nothing. So, on the 31st, I tested. I had a very strange result..&#xa;&#xa;19 minutes ago&#xa;I kind of saw a second line, but it was a "ghost" line (spooky on Halloween huh?!?! LOL) I posted a question "Trick-0r-Treat?" and got alot of good responses that prompted me to retest last night. It came back positive!!!! Hubby got home at 3am and told me to test again when I showed it to him (since 5hrs had elapsed). SO, I did. Same Positive. &#xa;I got my blood drawn this morning and I'm waiting for the official word, but 3+ seem pretty sure to me.&#xa;So, I want to share my experience, the symptoms I've had and hopefully help some of you out there.&#xa;Don't worry about trying the numbers game, "when do I ovulate..." Just try to relax, and have sex everyday, as long as mr. sex doesn't have a low sperm count.&#xa;Try the PreSeed instead of your usual lubricants. and heck, what would it hurt to try propping your legs up on the wall??&#xa;And don't get discouraged when theres a -, it might just be too early. Oh, and you don't have to spend more than a $1 on an HPT to get an acurate result...&#xa;&#xa;14 minutes ago&#xa;Symptoms I felt:&#xa;VERY gassy, whic is actually a symptom I didn't have with my daughter.&#xa;&#xa;Tender during sex. and some mild cramping.&#xa;&#xa;Slightly swollen breast, shooting pains when I got into the freezer section at the store, and my left breast leaked a very tiny bit of colostrom...I did just have a baby, but haven't breast fed in 5 mos.&#xa;&#xa;Fatigue, headaches.&#xa;&#xa;LOOSE stool. some women get constipated. I've had some easy poops!&#xa;&#xa;On one day, I had some period like cramping (about 12 days before my period was due) It only lasted about an hour, but then it when away.&#xa;&#xa;Slight waves of neausea at no particular instant.&#xa;&#xa;A craving for spicy food.&#xa;&#xa;Irritability.

<subject>Puppy has seizures?</subject><content>Does anyone have a dog or puppy that has siezures?  I think that this may be what's wrong with my puppy.  She will be fine for a long time, soetimes even as long as 2 days.  Then suddenly it seems like she can't even walk.  She just lies there.  When she does try to get up, she just wobbles. Then any where from 10 mins to an hour later, she's completely back to normal.  Playing, walking, barking, etc.  We noticed her eyes rolling back in her hand today, and I thought that maybe she was having a siezure.  I know that most siezures are violent, but some can be paralazxing.  I know I need to take her to the vet, before anyone says that.  I was just wondering if anyone has had any experiance with this.  Is this what it is, or could it be something else?  If your dog has siezures, how did the vet treat?  She is 7 weeks old.  she is a lab- chow mix, if it makes a difference.  If not siezures, any other ideas on what it could be?  Planning on taking her to vet SOON, just wanting some opinions</content>

<subject>Is my husband's violence medical or plain "abuse"?</subject><content>My husband suffers from epilepsy that may be caused by brain damage or has brain damage from seizures.  He attacked me one night in front of our 3 year old son.  It was truly out of the blue and over nothing - we had not been arguing.  I asked him to get the pizza out of the oven and he jumped up cussing and charged me, swinging.  He wouldn't let me out of the house.  I had to beg.  He has had episodes like this in the past, but usually after a seizure and directed at other people.  One time it took 2 police officers and 2 emt's to tie him to a gurney because he was fighting them.  I am afraid for my son and myself and have left him, though love him deeply when he's not like this.  In counseling, I've realized there have been control issues : i.e. telling me how to dress, quizzing me on where I've been, etc.  He kept justifying what happened until he got my divorce papers, now he's seeking counseling and I don't know what to do.  I can't blame him for medical, but can't go back in fear</content>

<subject>Medco, Caremark, pharmacy-benefit management companies, as a patient, how does it work?</subject><content>I have health insurance coverage by Anthem. Recently I've been reading about Pharmacy Benefit Managers and how a lot of their business is Mail order. I read they squeeze margins and take away business from retail pharmacy. But what I don't understand is, from a patient's perspective, how does this work? Do they have their insurance like Anthem, and then also Medco? Or is Medco their insurance? So a patient goes to their doctor and gets a prescription. Usually they'd then go to their pharmacy and pick it up, pay a co-pay while their insurance covers the rest. Where does Medco come in with their competing mail order? What's the difference between health insurance and these pharmacy benefit managers? Please keep your answer in the perspective of the patient. I've read about it from the business angle and I'm confused as hell to how it works. Thanks in advance!!</content>

<subject>Would anyone be interested in experimenting in a (body swap) w/me?</subject><content>Your will-power must be strong to do this. Any advanced experience with astral projection, mataphysics, or sorcery is a sure plus. I've posted several times about this topic, and I've met quite a few intriquing people. If you're more than just intersted, feel free to drop a message. It would be fascinating to actually meet someone who would like to try this w/me, who isn't bluffing, wishy washy, or who is some secret type of investigator- I've met scores of you people.  Yeah, I'd love to experiment with it. Although, my shell is rather handsome, as well as very healthy too, I don't expect to encounter anyone who has a fair offer; I'm not that picky about who I would try it with. I've got an open mind. If I don't get any cool replies soon, I may just merely stop posting about it altogether.</content>

I was hanging out by myself in my usual spot among the trees by the school oval, minding my own business, and these two boys decided it was a 'boys only' spot. I argued the point, and we agreed to a fight to decide it. Next thing I know, I've kicked the bigger of the two in the mouth and they're running away. Never bothered me again.

<subject>What are some career fields for someone with good "spatial reasoning" skills and weak "verbal reasoning"?</subject><content>Whenever I take any IQ tests I seem to have pretty strong spatial reasoning skills (the ability to think in 3d). However, my verbal skills are very poor. It takes forever for me to even begin to remember a new word or phrase. What are some careers that could work for me? I already finished a degree in Computer Networking and that requires way too much terminology, so that is out of the question. Does anyone have any other ideas?</content>

<subject>Does it seem that all the kind familiar faces on this forum have left, leaving us with the judgemental ones?</subject><content>Please do not take offense to this question.If you do not see yourself as being judgemental, then this question does not apply to you. But for the rest who preach to those who dont follow their structure of belief. I wonder do you feel that you are being example of your faith, by judging others who do not follow yours. The word is faith right? This implys a belief of something that can not be seen. So if you have true faith in what you believe in, then there is no need to judge or convert others. Unless it is you who feel you need to be validated by what you believe in. So if that is the case, then who is it that truly lacks faith?  The one who says what you believe is acceptable, or the ones who say you can only be accepted if you have faith in what I believe, because the rest is false relgion and false prohets that will lead you astray. Just wondering</content>

<subject>Would you consider this grounds to assume cheating?</subject><content>I was bored at work the other day, and randomly typed my boyfriends screen name into google, and an online dating posting popped up.  We have been dating for two years and I never knew he had one.  It shows that he has not paid to be a member since the month that we met, but the account has remained active, meaning he has signed in and sent messages to people within the last two weeks.  Is this a reason to worry?  I feel like girls blow things out of proportion, and our relationship is very serious. I am very hurt to find this.  Should i confront him?  I know all his passwords, so I could just sign in and read everything, but that doesnt seem right, but neither does the fact that he is maintaining an online profile....</content>

<subject>Another 2 months without a period. Back in June I went without it 2 months, then it went back to normal.?</subject><content>Anywho, back in June I went two months without my period, so in early august I went out and bought 5 tests, all negative. I went to a family planning place, that test was negative. I even went to the hospital and that was negative. So I wait a few weeks and there's my period, it lasted 7 days. September rolls around, my period comes as expected for 5 days, which was normal before this happened. Now it's early november and guess what, no period. I'm not sure what's wrong, I don't have insurance, and I can't afford medical help so I'm just kind of stuck here in the blue. I feel mild discomfort, like dizzyness, irritibility, short temper, headaches, drowsyness, no cramping, my boobs did hurt for a little bit but that went away, and I use the restroom alot. And that could be an aray of things, I drink too much tea and water, we've been moving into a house recently so all the stress could be causing everything else. I haven't bought a test yet cause I'm certian I'm not pregnant.</content>

<subject>Is this a healthy diet and exercise routine?</subject><content>I want to lose 15 - 20 pounds.  I normally have a fruit smoothie that I make from banannas, blueberries, strawberries, honey and apple juice or a cereal bar for breakfast.  I will eat some popcorn for a mornign snack and drink a bottle of water.  For lunch, I have a salad and a piece of fish (Talipia) or skinless chicken breast cooked on the George Forman Grill.  For dinner, I normally have basically the same.  Sometimes I will have steamed rice and a vegatable with fish or chicken.  Sometimes I have tuna and salad for dinner.  For snacks, I have cereal bars, cashews, craisins/raisins or popcorn.  I try to drink plenty of water.  I start aerobics on Monday and I will go two or three times a week.  I do 500 crunches in the morning before work and I lift 5lb weights doing arm exercises each morning.  It takes about 15 minutes to complete for toning.  I had thought about adding some Lipo 6 for a supplement to speed of my metabolism.</content>

<subject>Could our leaders learn from the Russians?</subject><content>When Bush and Blair wanted to kill or capture one man - Osama in Afghanistan, Saddam in Iraq - they waded in with tanks and aircraft, and tens of thousands of civilians died.&#xa;&#xa;When Putin wanted someone dead, he was disposed of in a way that almost seems to have been chosen specifically because nobody else would be at any risk at all.&#xa;&#xa;I'm not condoning a murder and stifling of free speech, but frankly, which was the greater crime? To order the death of one individual who one saw as a traitor, or to order a military invasion which was certain to lead to the deaths of many innocents?&#xa;&#xa;Who should be more mourned? A former secret agent who knew that he was risking his own life by what he said; or whole families, women children and all, who were just getting on with their lives when a 5,000lb bomb landed on them?&#xa;&#xa;Are UK journalists overreacting because this happened in Britain or because the man who died was working as a journalist?&#xa;&#xa;Are Russia's leaders just smarter than ours?</content>

I thought I was just having gastrointestinal problems from the Taco Bell I had earlier (around 6 pm).  From the time I went in bed to the time I woke up, I could smell the acrid smell.  Well, in the morning I started feeling a bit upset in the stomach because of the smell.  I finally woke up at 5:30 to go take my shower, but half way through the door, I just vomited.  And I vomited a lot.&#xa;&#xa;I'm sorry if I grossed anyone out or anything of the sort.  And please don't delete my question; I'm serious about this.</content>

<subject>Loud Click from 2001 Taurus?</subject><content>When I go to start the engine there is a loud click coming from the engine.  If you hold the key in start it just continues to click.  It is a very fast and very loud click.  If you look at the engine with the hood up it is coming from the right of the engine, but I cant figure out where it is coming from.  Reading from other sources it may be the starter or the starter solenoid.  Am I on the right track.  Could it be the battery perhaps, it seems the clicking is powerful.  I dont know.</content>
<subject>My girlfriend and I believe she may be pregnant..?</subject><content>My girlfriends last period was October 15, 2006. She and I had unprotected sex on the 25, 28, and 31 of October. Also on the 4 of Novemer. She is on no kind of birthcontrol. Her period was due on November 9. But still hasn't come, she said sometimes she is on a 28 day cycle, which would mean it was due today, although still nothing. She has been complaining of nausea, headaches, cramping (a week ago), lower back aches, and seems to be constantly tired. She took a pregnancy test on November 9, but it came out negative. I am wondering what are the chances she may have took it too early, or if it was a "false" negative. I'm only 18, I don't know how all this works. Please bear with me. Any advice would be appreciated.</content>

<subject>i am not sure i believe that jesus died on the cross, read the whole question?</subject><content>its very possible his rising from the dead means he just got better and made noise and freaked the guards out, considering the lack of education of the times this would seem possible, even in the 1800s they buried people they thought were dead but were actually still alive, if he actually survived it would have freaked people out enough to believe he had risen from the dead, due to thier lack of independent thinking and knowledge, 10 year olds today are brighter and more educated then they were 2000 years ago and if your high priest said it was so then you just believed him,i know i will get the radical christians saying that i am going south for eternity but is that really independent thinking of them,</content>

I have only met the friend once and I know he's attracted to me.  Also, I don't think things are going to work out with the guy I'm seeing.  We get along great as friends, but it's not there sexually.  It's just not there.  We have not  slept together.  Has anyone mastered the friend switch?  How do I see the friend again if I end things with the guy I'm dating?  I don't want this to interfere with their relationship.</content>

<subject>Question for the ladies - During sex I farted (a wet one) and my girlfriend left - why???  Need advice please?</subject><content>I have been dating my girlfriend for over a week. We went out Sat. to a restaurant to eat. She wanted to go to one place, but I wanted to go to the one I where I had a coupon (2 for 1). &#xa;&#xa;We went and ran into her friend there-I have to admit her friend was a hottie and I was kind of flirting. My gf got mad at me &amp; we argued about it on the way home. We made up &amp; we were having sex.  All of a sudden, I had to fart bad! I had been holding it in all night &amp; couldn't anymore. I pushed it out with such force, not realizing that it was a real WET fart &amp; it stunk! I thought it was funny and laughed. I reached over to grab a towel and started cleaning it up. The towel ended up being her shirt! &#xa;&#xa;After this she was mad &amp; demanded to go home.  I said no &amp; she can walk home if she wants as she is lives only a mile away. It was 40 degrees too. LOL! She left &amp; I called her the "C" word on the way out. I left her a msg to work it out IF she apologizes for leaving. Am I wrong or right about this?</content>

<subject>There is nothing wrong with dating a younger man okay?</subject><content>I mean yes I'm 17 and he's only 13 but there are so many reasons we should date:&#xa;&#xa;1. We're both children. In the eyes of the law, we're both kids. It's okay. And once I turn 18, we'll stop having sex. But I'll never stop loving him.&#xa;&#xa;2. He's very mature for his age. I'm very immature for mine. We fit!&#xa;&#xa;3. We have a lot in common&#xa;&#xa;4. He's sexy as hell&#xa;&#xa;5. My friends approve&#xa;&#xa;6. We're in love&#xa;&#xa;7. He's more experienced than I am. He wasn't a virgin when I met him, but I was. I lost my virginity to him :)&#xa;&#xa;So please try to understand how much I, a young GIRL, love this young BOY.&#xa;&#xa;And back off Jose!</content>
<subject>What is the best way to show empathy and support for loved ones in hard times (please read on)?</subject><content>My in-laws have been going through some serious crap lately... my father in law lost his father a couple months ago, now he is laid off from work, and just now his mother has gotten very sick and may have a terminal disease; this was all unexpected.  My mother in law's mother has been sick and is now getting worse.&#xa;&#xa;I get along with my in-laws better than I do my own parents.  We havent always been close but now we all love each other.&#xa;&#xa;I want to help them in this difficult time.  We have no money to ease the financial burden on them; I have been through losses, but I was much younger then; so I dont know what I should do or say now as an adult.  How can I be supportive and understanding?  What can I possibly say?  I feel awful because I'm so powerless to be of any real help.  Especially with regards to my husband's 2 grandmothers... they may not have long and its so hard when you know they could go any day.  How can I be more supportive?  Thanks in advance.</content>
<subject>Ladies: How long do you wait till you call a guy?</subject><content>I met a very nice, attractive woman who works at a Banana Republic. We talked for while, she almost got in trouble for talking to me for so long - Im 100% positive she was attracted to me. When I met her later in the week (to exchange my sweater) we talked some more, I didnt want to come off as tacky &amp; ask her for her number at her workplace so I gave her my card and asked her to a 'coffee date', when I left she even said "see you soon", that was over a week ago. . .I got no call and im a little confused.

'start windows in safe mode', etc. @ the bottom of the screen, it says 'CMOS checksum error-Defaults Loaded Press F1 to enter setup'. i choose 'start windows normally' &amp; everything seems normal. i log into my account &amp; the desktop appears &amp; then goes black. sounds like it's running but nothing's on the screen. i turn it off(w/ a switch @ the back of the computer), turn it on, &amp; restart it. a robotic lady's voice(a recording) speaks from the actual computer. she says 'The processor might be damaged or not installed properly. [Damage dishcharge may be in battery].' (not sure what she said in brackets) everytime i turn it on, the voice speaks. its spoken b4 it's not sth. new. any ideas what's wrong? can this be fixed/solved? or just get a new one?</content>

<subject>Is it possible to have a reverse fold in a flat die cut corrugated cardboard box insert?</subject><content>I'm designing a box insert from C-flute corrugated cardboard. I want to make a suspended sunken platform and the design I have come up with requires 2 normal folds and 2 reverse folds. The firm doing the die cutting tell me that folds can only go one way when using flat die cutting machinery. This totally screws up my design so i'm wondering if a reverse fold can be made anyway or if there is a way to cut the board such that a reverse fold is enabled. e.g. cutting each end of the fold line, aligning the fold line parrallel to the corrugations or punching slots through the fold line.</content>

<subject>Should modern languages be taken more seriously in school curricula?</subject><content>It appears that the days of foreign languages may be limited in England as debate continues as to whether they should be removed from the curriculum altogether. Currently students in English schools have to study a foreign language - usually one of French, German or Spanish.&#xa;My personal view is that, actually, languages should be part of the core of modern teaching and, in England, should be taught in much greater detail than they actually are at the moment. I studied German at school; I also studied Spanish for one year. Yet I felt that the basis of teaching these languages was (and no doubt still is) largely based on set phrases rather than the understanding of the grammar and the amassing of vocabulary. More should be done to give students a chance to understand how the language works. &#xa;A second language is invaluable and greater emphasis should be placed thereon. There may even be a case to start teaching languages at a much lower age than the current age of 11.&#xa;Do you agree?</content>

<subject>Is this guy an example of a control freak with women?</subject><content>I have a guy friend who is very charming and handsome.  He knows how to get women to like him and he makes them believe they are special, etc.  And, then when they like him he turns his his back on them or is mean. I know because it happened to me. I thought he liked me etc. and so do the other women except it turns out to be the opposite.  He is starting to hear how he comes across and he does not get it.  He is kind of dumb to what women want I think.  He has been married like three or four times already and is in his 40s.  I would not want to date him or any other guy like him.  I thought I want to date him but then found out more about him that I don't like.</content>

<subject>When minority rights supersede the majority rights, where does the peoples choice come in?</subject><content>you have contracts given to minority just because they are minorities for the sake of equality...but that isn't fair to people who never did anything wrong...you have many muslims complain about civil rights abuse anytime we do anything that involves them...but our safety doesn't matter...you have people display Jesus in a jar a piss...but no one dares draw mohammad...why do the rights of the majority come second to minorities and their "freedoms"...what about the peoples soveriegnty...in Mass. the law makers are blocking a public vote on gay marriage...why can't they let the majority vote on it...are minorities choice more important than majority choice...it seems this is the stance of many liberals and the laws that keep popping up in the name of civil liberties while the majority lose their power...doesn't this kind of move seem more like a dictatorship represented by the few rather than a democracy by the people...it seems americans are being held hostige by their own stupidity...</content>

<subject>How to change GP? (in UK)?</subject><content>My husband wants to change G.P and it would make sense to be with my GP and that of my son. My husbands GP is very insensitive and indifferent and the infrequent times my husband does see him, he always feels the need to say how wonderful my deceased father in law was!! He was actually a very abusive husband and father to my husband and his sister!  Therefore my husband always comes away quite upset at these remarks.  Do I have to list these reasons to change? OR, write to the GP of choice first just to enquire and then see if they ask for reasons why he wants to change?</content>

<subject>Do you believe we expect too much from ex spouses?</subject><content>As a new ex wife I read alot of questions on here about how to deal with crazy ex wives and husbands. People seem to be very negative about exs. Why is that? I know there are some ex wives and husbands who are not nice but I often wonder is they have a reason to be. I wonder if we expect too much from them? My ex left me for another woman after having an affair. Our marriage was troubled but I was commited to making it work. He was not. He and the other woman now want to re-establish a relationship with me for the sake of our kids. I am not interested. The kids live with me and visit them every other weekend. I do not say anything bad about them to the kids - I support my ex husband's  relationship with his children. But that is all I am willing to give (at least right now). I do not want to be friends - especially with the other womans. They broke my heart and my kids' hearts. Does that make me a bad person?</content>

<subject>My history teacher is 28 years old and is engaged.  Could it be possible for a teacher and student to date?</subject><content>I know this is WAY wrong, but I think I love him.  Every day after school I find an excuse to stay after.  He treats me less like a student and more like a friend.  Once he took me to coffee.  I've never met his fiance and to tell you the truth, I don't want to.  He recently invited me to his wedding.  I don't WANT to go, it would be too painful, but I want to object.  He loves ME, not that other disgusting creature wearing the size 15 wedding dress (I'm guessing!)!  Help me.  We love each other, and our love is PURE.  He doesn't know it yet, but he wants to marry me.  Maybe we can have 12 children and live in a mansion by the sea.  I know I'm young, but I'm NOT naive.  I know this is right.  I can feel it.  The question is, how to break it to the fiance.  And I need to start shopping for wedding dresses, because the wedding is next week.  P.S. my teacher doesn't know anything about my desires, he probably thinks that our love will never be.  My parents are aware of this and approve.</content>

<subject>Smokey Piano smell will it cause health problems???</subject><content>We got a wonderful old upright piano from my husband's side of the family this weekend. It is my dream piano and I love it!!!!!! We have put it in our homeschooling room/diningroom. The problem is the piano was in the home of smokers. UG!!! My husband got some Old English and rubbed it down really good and he said it looks like he remembers it when he was a child. &#xa;&#xa;The problem is it still has the smoke smell to it. We got some Renuzit Super Odor Killer &amp; set it on top of the piano and it seems to have helped a tad. But my daughters &amp; I just finished doing about an hours worth of school and I noticed well I feel like like I am having a little trouble breathing. &#xa;&#xa;I am having sinus problems &amp; will see an Ear, Nose &amp; Throat dr today so I wonder if it is just because of that.

But when we're apart he never calls and emails me rarely.  I would like a phone call or email at least every other day but he might go like 5 days without emailing.  I'm so crazy about him though I'm practically stalking him (though not).  Is this normal for him to be doing this?  Am I just expecting too much?</content>

His mom is also my teacher and we get along great. She loves me to death and really wants me with her son. I really like him and i know he likes me but im not sure how much. at the beginning he would always ba calling me and sending me sweet texts and everything was great. But now, only like one month later he has really distanced himself. I try to be patient cuz I know he is busy (he plays sports and is getting ready to be a college football player) but its really starting to get on my nerves. he hardly ever calls and when i text he is always "busy". Ive confronted him already and it turned into a big mess because of our "big egos". One night he apologized for acting rude and told me he really wants to be with me but then things went down hill again after that. Should i end it now, im losing patience!</content>

<subject>Is anyone else disgusted by OJ and his latest stunt??</subject><content>I was watching CNN last night with the Goldman sister and father talking about this latest OJ book.  For years I have contended that OJ is innocent of all the charges because a jury of his peeps said so.  I felt that people needed to leave him alone and just let him life his life and stop trying to always blame him for something that he didnt do. &#xa;But this book is just plain sick.  Even if he didn't do it, why in the world would this man write a book explaining how he would have done it??  I mean this was an innocent man and the mother of his children who were brutally murdered.  His children must be so outraged and not to mention embarassed by his latest stunt.  And why in the world would FOX broadcast this nonsense?  And why would any publishing company want to  make money off of such a sick and twisted event that took place.  What is the world coming to when people would stoop to such all time lows just to make money????  Help us Lord.</content>

We've been cruel and judgemental, forgetting that you are no more sinful than we.  We are ALL sinners in need of a Savior.  I don't understand why we attack you for your lifestyle when we ourselves are guilty of everything from lust, adultery, fornication, lying, stealing, you name it!  So, it's unfair that we single you out and condemn you.  Please pray for us.  We don't realize the harm we're doing.  I assure you that I am doing all I can to have my brothers and sisters in the faith recognize our problem.  I am asking for your perpetual forgiveness for it seems the problem may never go away.  But I for one love you and it is my hope that we all find our way to heaven.  I urged you people to forgive us last night and I was delighted with your kind response - but I feel I must continue to ask so that you will be reminded that we are not all gay bashers - some of us have genuine compassion for you and respect and appreciate you for the precious people that you are.</content>

They have so much in common, in fact, if I didn't know any better I'd say they were brother and sister just by their similar behaviour and personalities. They seem to be close and they confide in each other alot. What can I possibly say to this girl so I can get her to understand that she is definately headed down the wrong path.

<subject>Learning singing?</subject><content>I'm not that bad at singing and i have been dancing since i wqas 5, skating since i was 8 so dancing and singing are a part of my life and people who really want to sing and dance are those who when some music comes on, something leaps inside them and they just want to run up there and start singing and dancing and you can actually see the music. I'm really passionate about it although i'm afraid of people hearing me so i hardly sing much around the house. I really want some advice on singing (not dancing) and if anyone copies and pastes stuff from websites, that really doesn't help much, i want you to write stuff that you actually understand otherwise i won't be able to understand it lol. Also, i'm really afraid to take singing lessons because i know i don't have much confidence?!?!?!</content>

Also it's impossible to disagree with everything the other side say's. Both of these guys distort the truth to fit their political agenda. I will agree that they can be entertaining, but how can some of you listen to what they say and think you’re getting the whole story. I listen to both sometimes (again I consider them entertainers) and I've heard several people quote them almost word for word as what they say is fact. So raise you hand if you one of these people that believe everything these guys tell you is the truth.</content>

<subject>Still not understading Him????????</subject><content>As I said in another question I do not understand my boyfriend at all. We have been together for 3+ months, I love him so dearly. He can only say I love you when he has been drinking. He treats me with love, everything about what he does screams that He loves me. We spend 5 out of 7 days of the week together. We have been away for a long weekend and we are going away on another trip for a week. He has said 2 things that I really dont get. I asked if he loved me, he said yes I do but I don't. What in the hell does that mean? Also that it will take him 4-6 months total for him to be "all In" I dont Understand what All In means as I asked and he said everything, well what is everything? Living together? Marrage? WHAT? And why is it men put a time restraint on love, if you love someone why do you need a time frame? You love them, that is it! Does he expect me to change? Be a different person at 6 months than I was at 1, 2, or 3 months? I'm not one of those wishy washy girls who are fake!</content>

<subject>Is this joy?</subject><content>Pleasan it is, when on the great sea the winds trouble the waters, to gaze from shore upon another's great tribulation: not because any man's troubles are a delectable joy, but because to percieve what ills you are free from yourself is pleasant. &#xa;&#xa;PS. If all that Nature barks for is that pain be removed away out of the body and that the mind be kept away from care and fear, why do we need then these pains, why these sorrows? Do we really need to fear the Gods?</content>

<subject>Is the policy of "nation-building" just a pathetic example of weak half measures?</subject><content>Go to this website, and hear directly from the Islamic community, just how they feel about our culture. http://www.memritv.org/&#xa;&#xa;The problem is deeply rooted in the culture itself. Those who have said that its an issue of poverty or government were wrong. Some of the most prominent Jihadists come from wealthy families. Oil-rich Islamic countries have no shortage of terror cells and people who hate kafirs (non-muslims).&#xa;&#xa;Iraq is a conudrum, no doubt about it, and it was before we made the poor decision to go in with the plan of nation building. For that matter, the entire Islamic world is a quagmire...conundrum. How do we respond....with half measures. Perfect for them, because they dont have the resources to fight with us any other way...we are fighting on their terms and no using our strength.&#xa;&#xa;Whats are strength? Yep, its bombs...big ones...all types. "OH NO..HUMANS RIGHTS...JUSTICE!!" &#xa;&#xa;Fine, just make sure to write "half measures" on our gravestone.</content>

<subject>To the men? What does this really mean when guys say it?</subject><content>I have known a man for 10 years. 5 years ago, I let my irish temper get the best of me and I called it off between us. I rushed into a marriage I later found out was abusive, and he was there for me. Everything is planned out now, but I have some questions. What does it really mean when a man says "No matter who you marry, you'll always belong to me?" What does it mean, upon seeing your children and spoiling them rotten, when he says, in a good sort of sad way and not a bad one "They should have been from me. But you dumped me". What does it mean when you are talking, and the man says he wants more children in the future? Especially when you have to work hard most of the time to get his feelings out in the first place? What does it mean when he says he never thinks anything badly of you and that just a look from you "drives him nuts" and he can't resist kissing you? Is this just talk, or is it real since he didn't try anything in the beginning?</content>

Will it help?&#xa;What neutralizes the odor? and what keeps the behavior from repeating itself ?? I used white vinegar and water in the past along with so many different products. Does anything really work ???&#xa;IF you used something and you found it actually DID work, please share !&#xa;Thanks</content>

I have been sick since I got home this am.  I am worried since I never done this before.  Trust me last time too.  I hate coffee, I drank OJ, one coke and mostly water.  What should I do now.</content>

I asked for advice on how to remove it (on Yahoo answers)</subject><content>and some moron told me to use toothpaste with a moistened q-tip. He said to use a slightly abrasive toothpaste like Colgate and to go over the scratch in circular motions (like polishing a shoe).

It's just a slightly different colored spot smack in the middle of my $2,300 4 month-old widescreen tv. Is there anything I can do to at least remove the spot?</content>

<subject>HELP!!! how to get rid of the reddish glow???</subject><content>Hello everybody!&#xa;&#xa;I'm a 37 year old man and I've been trying covering grey hair with hair color products, mostly common shelf products (Just for Men, Grecian etc). My problem is that every time I use it (regardless of the shade of the color), my hair always turns out with the same reddish glow!!! I feel frustrated because it is immediately noticed in public. My original natural color is dark brown and I have tried from lighter brown to real black shade. It is important to point out that I always follow the instructions very closely. What can I do to fix this? I heard that mixing blue or green base with brown 5-minute formulas that I usually use could help. Also, what brands&#xa;should I look for? Please help!!!&#xa;Thanks!</content>

<subject>What's wrong with me?</subject><content>I'm a 20-something year old unhappily married mom of 3 great kids ages 5, 3, and 2.. Lately I've found myself bored with my eveyday life and feel like I need more. (More than just raising my children, taking care of an ungrateful spouse and busting my a$$ at work) The only satisfaction I have now is with my children and my job. Sometimes (today for example) I dont want to come home from work. I dont drink, so I dont go to bars or anything like that, I dont have any friends to hang out with because my life revolves solely around my family. It seems that the only time I have to myself is the 25 minute drive on my way to and from work, and the 30 minutes before going to bed at night and engaging in the same ol redundant routine ALL OVER AGAIN. It's so hard to talk to my 'husband' about it because he doesnt actively listen and  it will just turn into an argument. I'm done arguing.  Can anyone offer any USEFUL advice?</content>

Tow trucks are coming in and hauling off the cars that no longer work in people's yards.  They call them eye sores.

There were a lot of angry people too....  Is that really fair?</content>

<subject>Is this even fair? Please, any input is appreciated. Thanks?</subject><content>I'm a junior in high school &amp; babysit for a group of 4 couples every school week. There are 7 kids, two per family except one, &amp; I watch them for 2 hectic, I-want-to-kill-myself hours. Anyway, regularly I get paid $5 an hour for each separate family. So for the very 1st couple of weeks, they were each paying me about $10 for the two hours, &amp; I made like $35 each night &amp; I was like, okay, this is good I can keep doing this. But then I started getting $20 for the nights rather than the $35, and I realized they started paying me only about 5 each. And then the last couple of weeks, one of the couples stopped paying me completely &amp; I'm down to about $15 for 2 hours for 7 kids. I don't want to say anything to that couple though. These people are always changing the schedule without letting me know &amp; sometimes calling me the day-of their meetings, expecting me to show. It's not like I don't have homework; I take AP classes &amp; I get really stressed sometimes. Is this fair what they're doing?</content>

I think the up front cost is all you should have to pay and when that time runs out renew it very simple. They have the parents by the hairs here and it isnt fair..

<subject>What compels people to lie or make up stories in defense of the holocaust?</subject><content>In no way is meant to insult anyone. However the truth is there to say it is fact. But I wonder why is it continuing after over a half a century on down to other generations, to defend this horrible thing that was done to not only the Jews but to the World? Is it because they are of a German descent and feel guilty or is it because they are of the same belief of that hideous order the Third Reich? I would like to know why the hatred of something from an old decadent system is still haunting us? Why people dont let go of this hatred? After all they were not even alive then, why do people carry on these traditions that are obviously losers.</content>

<subject>How do I find a meth lab in a rural setting?</subject><content>My neighbor was arrested a couple of weeks ago for manufacturing meth in his home and possibly on my rural property. I'm hardly ever down on the farm anymore, so he had plenty of privacy to commit his crimes. I found one of his campfire sites near a creek on the property, but, at the time, didn't know it was for drug making.&#xa;&#xa;What do I look for? Is there a smell? What does it smell like when it is being heated? Anyone with first hand experience in finding meth labs out in the woods reading this and can offer suggestions on how to prevent this from happening again?&#xa;&#xa;It's embarrassing to know the DEA, FBI, and such were on my place as well as his looking for dope making materials. I was told the drug sniffing dogs signalled many times on the abandoned house on the property, but when I went inside the house last week, I could find nothing out of place. Can I rent a dope sniffing dog to go on my own property and look for this hazardous material before it pollutes the ground water?</content>

<subject>Does anyone know any ways to get rid of a persistent infection?</subject><content>I apparently have an infection on the ring finger of my left hand, in a cut almost an inch long which I got from a nail. I have had it for about half a week. Despite dowsing it in peroxide and neosporin, it's still there, and doesn't appear to be getting any better.&#xa;&#xa;What I originally thought was a scab formed over it early on. I believe it is actually dried puss, as it is yellow, is depressed in the skin instead of raised, and when I put peroxide or neosporin on it, it softens into a mucus-like substance. I tried removing it when it was soft, but it won't come out, and I don't want to forcebly pull it out since I'm not a doctor or anything and don't know what I'm doing :p&#xa;&#xa;The infected area is sore, and I'm starting to become a bit concerned. Any suggestions, especially ones that are proven effective, would be much appreciated. Thank you to the answerers, and God bless you all!</content>

<subject>KRZR K1m or the LG VX8600 cell phone?</subject><content>I am getting a phone for my niece and I have decided on 2 possible phones to choose from to get her.&#xa;&#xa;The phone I was originally going to get her was the KRZR K1m ( http://www.mobiledia.com/phones/motorola/krzr-k1m.html ). However, when I called and talked to the lady at Verizon that I was going to order it from, she notified me about a new phone that just came out from LG called the VX8600 ( http://www.mobiledia.com/phones/lg/vx8600.html ). &#xa;&#xa;Being that the phone JUST came out, I didn't see it when I was originally looking for which phone to get her.&#xa;&#xa;Anyways, I need people's opinions on which one they think is a better phone overall. She's a high school student so I thought one of these two would be best for her since they are a good size (not to wide, not too tall, not too thick) and they also have a bunch of features on them that I think she'd enjoy.&#xa;&#xa;Thanks for the help.</content>
